Song: "Digital Echoes" - Music Composition Notes

BPM: 110
Key: A minor

Intro (8 bars):
- Start with a soft, pulsing synth pad in A minor
- Gradually introduce subtle glitch effects
- Use a low-pass filter sweep to build anticipation

Verse 1 (16 bars):
- Introduce a minimalist beat: kick on 1, snare on 3
- Add evolving synth arpeggios in A minor
- Use a soft, atmospheric pad for harmony
- Introduce a subtle bassline following the chord progression: Am - C - G - F

Chorus (16 bars):
- Fuller arrangement with layered synths
- Strong 4/4 beat with additional percussion elements
- Main synth melody emphasizing the vocal melody
- Chord progression: Am - F - C - G

Verse 2 (16 bars):
- Similar to Verse 1 but with added complexity
- Introduce a counter-melody with a different synth sound
- Add more intricate drum patterns in the background
- Gradually increase the intensity of the bassline

Bridge (8 bars):
- Break down to glitchy effects and atmospheric pads
- Use granular synthesis on some of the previous elements
- Incorporate a new, unsettling chord progression: Dm - Bb - F# - A

Outro (16 bars):
- Start with elements from the bridge
- Gradually reintroduce elements from the chorus
- Build up to a climax around bar 12

Sound Design Notes:
1. Main synth: Use a combination of subtractive and FM synthesis for a rich, evolving texture
2. Bass: Start with a simple sine wave, gradually introducing harmonics throughout the song
3. Drums: Layer acoustic drum samples with electronic sounds for a hybrid feel
4. Glitch effects: Use granular synthesis and buffer effects on various song elements
5. Pads: Combine multiple detuned sawtooth waves with a long attack and release for an atmospheric sound

Next steps:
1. Create a basic arrangement in the DAW following this structure
2. Design the core synth sounds
3. Program the main drum patterns
4. Develop the bassline
5. Add atmospheric elements and effects
