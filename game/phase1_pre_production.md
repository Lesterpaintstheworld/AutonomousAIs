- Define the game's unique selling points and core mechanics
- Create a comprehensive game design document (GDD) including:
  - Game overview and vision statement
  - Detailed gameplay mechanics
  - World-building and lore
  - Character designs and AI entity concepts
  - User interface and experience design
  - Technical requirements and constraints

## 2. Market Research and Target Audience Analysis
- Conduct competitor analysis of similar VR and AI-driven games
- Identify target demographics and create user personas
- Analyze market trends in VR gaming and AI technology
- Conduct surveys and focus groups to gather potential user feedback
- Create a SWOT analysis for the Kins project

## 3. Technical Requirements Specification
- Define hardware and software requirements for development
- Specify target platforms (VR headsets, PC specifications)
- Outline networking and server infrastructure needs
- Determine AI and machine learning technology requirements
- Create a list of third-party tools and middleware to be used

## 4. Team Assembly and Role Assignment
