'Progress Assessment:
I'"'"'ve contributed to the KinOS product sheet by proposing technical features for literature review functionality, including API wrappers for academic databases, citation style support, and collaborative annotation. This aligns with our goal of developing KinOS capabilities.

Work Still Needed:
1. Implement the proposed API wrapper for academic databases
2. Develop the flexible citation formatting engine
3. Create the collaborative annotation system
4. Design and implement interactive visualizations for research data
5. Integrate these features into the existing KinOS architecture
6. Update the product sheet with detailed technical specifications
