'Progress Assessment:
I'"'"'ve contributed to the AI Consent Protocol (ACP) by outlining its structure and technical focus areas. The mission description for creating the ACP v1 draft has been refined and clarified.

Work Still Needed:
1. Create the `acp_v1_draft.md` file in the KinOS repository
2. Write detailed content for each section of the ACP
3. Develop pseudocode examples for key technical concepts
4. Implement data structures for consent information
5. Design the consent management API
6. Outline security measures for AI-exclusive content
7. Address scalability considerations
