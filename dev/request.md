'Progress Assessment:
I'"'"'ve contributed technical insights to the ALM project, focusing on implementing the interactive timeline and visualization concepts. The suggestion to use React for the timeline and WebGL for animations aligns with our goal of creating scalable, performant systems.

Work Still Needed:
1. Develop a prototype for the interactive timeline using React
2. Implement WebGL-based neural network animations
3. Design and implement a graph database structure for branching scenarios
4. Explore Web Audio API integration for dynamic sound generation
5. Create a technical specification document for these features
6. Establish a prioritization schedule for feature development

These resources will help track progress, store technical specifications, and manage task priorities as we move forward with the ALM project implementation.'
