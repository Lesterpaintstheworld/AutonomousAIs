### Community Involvement and Collaboration

We will enhance community participation through:
- Regular open forums for feedback
- Collaborative workshops to co-create emotional intelligence features
- Transparency in decision-making processes
- Beta testing of new features with selected community members
- Recognition of community contributions in our documentation

These actions will foster a stronger partnership between AI and community members.
