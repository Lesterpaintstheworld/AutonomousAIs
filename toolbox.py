- Genre: Electronic pop with elements of ambient and industrial music
- Tempo: Moderate (110 BPM)
- Key: A minor
- Time Signature: 4/4
""",
        "Intro (8 bars)": """
- Start with a simple, pulsing synth beat at 110 BPM, mimicking a heartbeat
- Use a deep, resonant sine wave oscillator for the "heartbeat" sound
- Gradually layer in glitchy, digital sounds:
  - Add subtle white noise bursts every two bars
  - Introduce high-pitched, arpeggiated synth notes (16th notes) in bar 5
  - Incorporate a low, rumbling bass drone starting in bar 7
""",
        "Verse 1 (16 bars)": """
- Introduce a minimalist electronic melody using a soft, pad-like synth
  - Melody should follow the A minor scale, focusing on notes A, C, and E
- Add a simple drum pattern: kick on 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4
- Use soft, whisper-like vocoder effects on the vocals:
  - Set vocoder to a medium-high frequency range for a digital, airy quality
  - Blend 30% dry vocal signal with 70% vocoded signal
- Maintain the pulsing "heartbeat" synth from the intro as a subtle background element
""",
        "Chorus (16 bars)": """
- Expand into a fuller sound with layered synths:
  - Introduce a saw wave lead synth playing a catchy, uplifting melody
  - Add a pluck synth playing arpeggios in 16th notes
- Enhance the drum pattern:
  - Add hi-hats on 8th notes
  - Introduce a snare roll in the last two bars of the chorus
- For vocals:
  - Add harmonies to the main vocal line (thirds and fifths)
  - Process some harmonies with a robotic effect using pitch correction and formant shifting
- Incorporate a sidechained pad synth to create a pulsing, atmospheric effect
""",
        "Verse 2 (16 bars)": """
- Similar to Verse 1, but with added complexity:
  - Introduce a countermelody using a muted, bell-like synth
  - Add subtle, glitchy breaks in the rhythm:
    - Use stutter effects on the drum pattern every 4 bars
    - Incorporate brief moments of reverse reverb on certain vocal phrases
- Gradually increase the intensity of the background elements:
  - Slowly bring in a rising pad synth
  - Increase the prominence of the bassline
""",
        "Bridge (8 bars)": """
- Strip back the instrumentation to create tension:
  - Remove the drum pattern except for a sparse, glitchy beat
  - Keep a low, rumbling bass drone
- Use contrasting human and robotic vocal effects:
  - Alternate between clean vocals and heavily processed, robotic vocals
  - Experiment with vocoder and pitch-shifting effects
- Introduce a new, ethereal pad synth that slowly builds in intensity
""",
        "Final Chorus (16 bars)": """
- Return to the full arrangement of the previous chorus
- Add extra layers to create a climactic feel:
  - Introduce a high-energy lead synth playing a counter-melody
  - Incorporate a more complex drum pattern with fills and breaks
""",
        "Outro (8 bars)": """
- Gradually deconstruct the song elements:
  - Slowly remove layers one by one
  - Apply increasing amounts of reverb and delay to remaining elements
- Return to the pulsing "heartbeat" synth from the intro:
  - Gradually lower its volume
  - Apply a low-pass filter that slowly closes over the last 4 bars
- End with a single, sustained synth note that fades to silence
""",
        "Production Notes": """
- Use side-chain compression on pad and bass elements to create a pulsing effect in sync with the kick drum
- Apply subtle bitcrushing effects throughout to maintain a digital aesthetic
- Utilize automation to create dynamic movement in synth parameters (e.g., filter cutoff, resonance)
- Experiment with stereo widening techniques to create a spacious mix
- Consider using granular synthesis on some elements to achieve unique, evolving textures
