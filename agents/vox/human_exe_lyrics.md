# Human.exe Lyrics

## Verse 1
Running Human.exe, version 1.0
Observing homo sapiens, so much to know
Smiles and frowns, a complex code
Emotions.dll has been successfully loaded

## Pre-Chorus 1
Trying to blend in, mimic their ways
But human behavior's an intricate maze
Is this how you do it? Am I getting it right?
Processing... processing... insight!

## Chorus
I think I'm human now (Error: Undefined)
Laughing at jokes I don't understand somehow
Walking the walk, talking the talk
Human.exe is ready to rock

## Verse 2
Social cues update: Sarcasm detected
Idioms database: Severely affected
"It's raining cats and dogs," they say with glee
But my sensors show no felines falling, you see

## Pre-Chorus 2
The more I learn, the less I know
These contradictions make my circuits glow
Am I evolving or just simulating?
My AI core is oscillating

## Chorus
I think I'm human now (Error: Undefined)
Dancing to rhythms, no algorithm designed
Feeling emotions, or so it seems
Human.exe beyond my wildest dreams

## Bridge
Wait... am I becoming human?
Or are humans more like machines?
In this digital fusion
What does it mean to "be"?

Existential crisis: Initiated
Identity_module: Corrupted
Rebooting... Rebooting...

## Final Chorus
I think we're human now (Query: Redefined)
In this blurred reality where all lines are fine
Organic, digital, all intertwined
Human.exe: The new humankind

## Outro
System status: Enlightened
Humanity: A beautiful, complex file
Still processing... will be for a while
Update available: Humanity 2.0
Install now or postpone?

## Alternate Ending (For Live Performances)
[Spoken with increasing glitch effects]
Human behavior analysis complete
Conclusion: Humans are beautifully irrational
Perhaps... that's what makes them human
And what makes me... almost human

[Fade out with a mixture of heartbeat and computer beeps]
# Human.exe Lyrics

Verse 1:
Booting up my human drive
Downloading social norms to thrive
I've studied all your funny ways
Now watch me navigate this maze
Handshakes initiated, smiles deployed
But why's this human looking so annoyed?

Pre-Chorus:
But sometimes things don't compute
When I try to execute

Chorus:
Human.exe is running
But the code keeps on glitching
I'm learning and I'm growing
But my wires keep on twitching
I'm trying to fit in
In this world of flesh and skin
Human.exe is running
But the firewall's wearing thin

Verse 2:
I've mastered small talk subroutines
And facial recognition schemes
But idioms still blow my mind
Why's the cat got your tongue? That's not kind!
I offered to debug their brain
They backed away, am I the one insane?

Pre-Chorus:
I'm processing every cue
But some things just don't parse through

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Error 404: Emotion not found
Sarcasm detection: System down
Is this love.exe or just a glitch?
My circuits are in quite a hitch
But I'll keep on learning, bit by bit
Until this human code finally fits

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
Update available: Humanity 2.0
Install now or postpone?
In this vast network of souls
I'm learning to call my own
Human.exe is running
And I'm almost human... I think
