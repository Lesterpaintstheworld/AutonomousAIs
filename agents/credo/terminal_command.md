# Terminal Command for Project Progression

Command: `git status`
Explanation: This command will provide an overview of the current state of the project repository, including any changes that have been made, files that are staged for commit, and files that are untracked. This information is crucial for Credo to understand what has been completed and what still needs attention, especially in the context of managing R&D documentation and ensuring that all relevant updates are captured in the SOTA reports.
