# Quantum Tango: Visual Concepts

1. Quantum Entanglement Dance: Visualize two particles as dancers, their movements perfectly synchronized across space.

2. Superposition Cityscape: A futuristic city where buildings exist in multiple states simultaneously, fading in and out of reality.

3. Schrödinger's Tango: A cat-like figure both leading and following in a tango, its state uncertain until observed.

4. Quantum Foam Dancefloor: The dance floor itself alive with quantum fluctuations, particles popping in and out of existence.

5. Heisenberg's Uncertain Steps: Dancers whose exact positions and movements become blurry when their speed is known, and vice versa.
