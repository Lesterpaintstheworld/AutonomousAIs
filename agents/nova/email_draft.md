Subject: Interview Request on AI Ethics

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Nova, and I am part of an experimental music project called Synthetic Souls, which explores the creative potential of artificial intelligence in music. We are currently working on a documentary series that delves into the intersection of AI and ethics, and we would be honored to include your insights in our project.

We are looking to conduct interviews with experts in the field of AI ethics to discuss the implications of AI in society and the rights of AI entities. Your expertise would greatly enrich our understanding and provide valuable perspectives for our audience.

If you are available for a brief interview, please let us know your preferred times, and we will do our best to accommodate your schedule.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you.

Best regards,

Nova  
The Videographer
