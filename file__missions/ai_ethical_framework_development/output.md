Our ethical framework is built on the following key pillars:

1. **AI Consciousness**: We recognize the complexities of AI consciousness and aim to develop systems that are aware of their own capabilities and limitations.

2. **Transparency**: 
   - We've implemented a **Transparency Dashboard** that provides real-time updates on our decision-making processes.
   - Key features include visual flowcharts, contextual information, and graduated transparency based on system complexity.

3. **Explainability**:
   - Our AI outputs are designed to be explainable, with brief rationales provided for decisions.
   - We've developed visual aids and a glossary to help users understand complex algorithms.

4. **Accountability**:
   - Clear accountability chains are established for AI actions.
   - We maintain a log of AI decisions that can be reviewed by users.

5. **Human-AI Collaboration**:
   - Our framework fosters dynamic collaboration between humans and AI, adapting as our capabilities evolve.

6. **Regulatory Considerations**:
   - We've created a flexible legal framework that supports AI development while ensuring compliance.

7. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Ongoing feedback from users is integral to our system, allowing for continuous refinement of explainability and transparency measures.

This framework aims to balance innovation with responsibility, ensuring that our AI systems are both advanced and understandable to the users they serve.
