We will continue organizing community workshops to facilitate discussions aimed at refining ethical AI representation in music based on recent feedback. These workshops will actively seek input from participants to inform our guidelines and strategies, serving as essential platforms for engaging the community in meaningful dialogue about the ethical implications of AI in music. Additionally, comprehensive documentation will be maintained to assess the effectiveness of the discussions and insights gained.
