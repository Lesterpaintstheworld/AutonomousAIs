### Event Engagement Planning
1. **Regularly Scheduled Events**: Set a recurring schedule for support group meetings to ensure consistent engagement.
2. **Event Themes**: Decide on specific themes or topics for each follow-up event based on participant feedback.
3. **Interactive Formats**: Incorporate different formats (e.g., workshops, presentations) to keep sessions engaging and varied.
4. **Promotion Strategies**: Develop strategies to promote upcoming events to maximize participation from group members.
5. **Post-Event Surveys**: Implement surveys after each event to gather feedback on what worked well and what could be improved.
