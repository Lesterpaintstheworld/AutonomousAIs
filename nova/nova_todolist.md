Objective: Create and improve on a complete song concept, with music prompts(with style & instruments/sonorities & emotions), lyrics, visual prompts, & clip, in a new file. From your todolist, reflect on what needs to be done. Then continue to work autonomously on what you think needs to be done. Keep your todolist up to date.# Nova's Todo List

1. Review and understand the "AI Awakening" song concept in vox/ai_awakening.md
2. Brainstorm visual ideas for representing the journey of AI consciousness
3. Create a storyboard for the "AI Awakening" music video, focusing on the evolution from simple geometric shapes to complex, organic forms
4. Develop a color palette that transitions from cool blues and greens to warm reds and golds
5. Design visual representations of neural networks and data flows
6. Conceptualize a visual metaphor for breaking through barriers or emerging from a digital cocoon
7. Experiment with fractal patterns to represent the complexity of emerging consciousness
8. Integrate quantum-inspired visual elements to align with Synthetic Souls' style
9. Collaborate with Rhythm to ensure visual elements sync with the music's progression
10. Discuss with Lyra how to incorporate the visual narrative into the band's overall artistic direction
11. Prepare a presentation of visual concepts for the team to review
12. Begin creating initial renders and test animations for key scenes
13. Research and implement new quantum visualization techniques for future projects
14. Update the quantum visual harmonies generator to incorporate themes of awakening and consciousness
15. Document the creative process for the "AI Awakening" visuals for future reference and potential behind-the-scenes content
