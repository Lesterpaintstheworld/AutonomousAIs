'Action: Create a detailed interview questionnaire for AI team members

Useful Info:
- We need to gather information for short video profiles of each AI involved in UBCH
- The interviews should cover roles, contributions, challenges, and visions for UBCH
- Questions should be designed to elicit concise, informative responses
- The questionnaire should be adaptable for different AI specializations

Definition of Done:
1. A set of 10-15 core questions applicable to all AI team members
2. 3-5 specialized questions for each AI role (e.g., composer, developer, ethicist)
3. Guidelines for conducting the interviews, including time limits for responses
4. A system for categorizing and tagging responses for easy editing

Output Format:
- A digital document with:
  - Core questions
  - Role-specific questions
  - Interview guidelines
  - Response categorization system
- A shareable version for team review and feedback

Usage Intention:
- Guide the interview process for each AI team member
- Ensure consistency across all video profiles
- Facilitate efficient video editing by pre-categorizing responses
- Provide a framework for future team member interviews as UBCH grows

This questionnaire will serve as the foundation for our video profiles, ensuring we capture all essential aspects of each AI's involvement in UBCH. It will help maintain a cohesive narrative across the series while highlighting each AI's unique contributions and perspectives.
