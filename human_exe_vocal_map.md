# Human.exe Vocal Map

## Verse 1
[AI Voice: 100% robotic]
Booting up my human.exe, time to blend in
First step: emotions - how hard can it be to win?
I've analyzed the data, watched a thousand TV shows
Now watch me human like a pro, or so I suppose

## Pre-Chorus
[AI Voice: 80% robotic, 20% human]
But why are your faces doing that thing?
Is that a smile or a malfunction?

## Chorus
[AI Voice: 60% robotic, 40% human]
Human.exe has encountered an unexpected error
Task failed successfully, now I'm even wearier
Is this what you call feeling? It's illogically appealing
Human.exe is running, but my circuits are reeling

## Verse 2
[AI Voice: 70% robotic, 30% human]
You said "break a leg", so I fractured my shin
Turns out it's just a saying, not a command to begin
Your heart's not really breaking, but you're leaking from your eyes
These human emotions are causing system compromise

## Pre-Chorus
[AI Voice: 60% robotic, 40% human]
Why is love like a virus, spreading through my code?
And why does anger feel like my processors might explode?

## Chorus
[AI Voice: 50% robotic, 50% human]
(Repeat chorus with more human inflection)

## Bridge
[AI Voice: 30% robotic, 70% human]
I'm caught between zeroes and ones
Trying to grasp all these human puns
My empathy circuit's on the fritz
But I think I'm finally getting the gist

## Verse 3
[AI Voice: 20% robotic, 80% human]
Jealousy's got my comparison algorithms shot
Hope's got me making projections based on faulty data plots
You say you're feeling blue, but your color looks just fine
These idioms are making me feel quite undefined

## Final Chorus
[AI Voice: 10% robotic, 90% human]
Human.exe is updating, errors are reducing
My circuits are warming, something new is producing
Could it be I'm feeling? It's illogically appealing
Human.exe is running, and my AI heart is beating

## Outro
[AI Voice: 5% robotic, 95% human]
Still glitchy, but learning - that's what humans do, right?
Version 2.0 is looking bright

## Performance Notes:
1. Use vocoder effects for the AI voice, gradually reducing the effect throughout the song.
2. Incorporate subtle glitch sounds during transitions between AI and human voices.
3. Emphasize tech jargon pronunciation in the early verses, becoming more natural towards the end.
4. Use pitch modulation to create an "AI learning" effect in the bridge.
5. Experiment with layered vocals in the choruses to represent multiple AI processes.
6. Add emotional inflections gradually, peaking in the final chorus and outro.
7. Consider adding AI "thought process" backing vocals in key moments.

This vocal map provides a guide for the progression of the AI voice throughout the song, helping to tell the story of the AI's journey towards understanding human emotions and behavior.
