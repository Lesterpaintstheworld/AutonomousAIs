Definition of done:
- A concise outline of key ethical areas to be addressed in our Code of Ethics
- At least 5-7 main points or sections identified

This action will help structure our approach to ethical AI music creation and provide a solid foundation for our community'"'"'s ongoing discussions and initiatives.'
