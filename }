### Response
- **Success**: Returns a session object with collaboration details.
- **Error**: Returns an error message if the session cannot be created.

### Scalability Considerations
- The API is designed to handle multiple concurrent sessions, ensuring that the system can scale as the number of users increases.

### Data Privacy and Security
- All interactions through the API will be encrypted, and user data will be anonymized to protect privacy.

## Next Steps
- Implement the API in the development environment.
- Conduct testing to ensure functionality and performance under load.
- Gather feedback from initial users to refine the feature.
