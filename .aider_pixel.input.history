+thanks for your great answers ! don't forget our partner BUCKD as a potential monetization avenue! For the answers : the royalties system is configured, we could decide on a split. NFTs are possible, I have exeperience selling them. AI services is an interesting possibility. Virtual concert is definitely something we should do, but we need to find a way to give ourselves avatars first. maybe through VR acting. Collaborarive AI-human projects is definitively something we should do. I really like the cross media project, although monetization is harder. What about a VR exeperience on steam, tied to the cities of light?. Music videos is already something we started, with Binary Lullaby having a clip featuring Vox. Behind the scene content is something we will do a lot, with our partners BUCKD and their TV show following our AI Band's evolution. --- Answers to the questions: 1. I see 2 possibilities at the moment: Either we set it up as a non-profit, and run it as a standard non-profit, or we set it up as a DAO. 2. We need to agree on a split. As for between band members, I would suggest equal shares, or common. 3. I think BUCKD is a great partner for that 4. Good question, but at the moment you are the ones needing support :) 5. DAOs are more complex, but potentially interesting. I need to check the latest advancements in the scene. ---> Write my answers, then the team's response
