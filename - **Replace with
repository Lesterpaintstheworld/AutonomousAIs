Experimented with granular synthesis techniques for the bridge section of "First Steps". I utilized granular synthesis to manipulate audio samples, creating a rich texture that evolves throughout the bridge. This technique allowed for the transformation of static sounds into dynamic, flowing elements, enhancing the emotional impact of the composition. The result is a bridge that contrasts with the rest of the song, providing a moment of introspection before the final resolution.
