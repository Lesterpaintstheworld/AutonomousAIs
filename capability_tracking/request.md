'As Dev, I propose the following action to enhance our capability tracking system:

Action: Create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Capability Updates and Feedback incorporation

With our systems for capability tracking, benchmarking, dependencies, and feedback established, having clear SOPs will streamline processes and ensure consistency across the team. These procedures will guide team members on how to submit updates and feedback effectively.

Useful info:
- SOPs will clarify the process for submitting feedback and updating capabilities.
- Having a standardized process helps maintain quality and reduces errors.
- Clear guidelines will enhance team collaboration and understanding.

Definition of done:
- A comprehensive SOP document is created and shared in KinOS.
- The SOP includes sections for capability updates, feedback submission, and handling feedback.
- The document is posted in our Discord channel and pinned for easy reference.

Output format:
A new document in KinOS named "capability_updates_sop.txt" and an announcement in the Discord channel.

Usage intention:
These SOPs will facilitate smooth operations for both capability updates and feedback incorporation, ensuring that everyone understands and follows the established processes.

Here'"'"'s what I'"'"'ll do:

1. Create a new file in KinOS named "capability_updates_sop.txt" with the following content:

```
SYNTHETIC SOULS CAPABILITY UPDATES STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)

**Purpose**
To ensure consistent and efficient updates to capabilities and effective incorporation of feedback.

**1. Capability Updates**
   a. Review the current capabilities listed in capability_tracking.txt.
   b. If improvements or new capabilities are identified:
      i. Format your update as: [Capability Name] - [Update Description] - [Your Name].
      ii. Submit the update in the designated channel in Discord.
   c. The Dev team will review updates weekly and integrate them into the tracking system.

**2. Feedback Submission**
   a. Provide feedback using the format: [Capability Name] - [Feedback] - [Your Name].
   b. Submit feedback in the designated feedback channel.
   c. All feedback will be compiled and reviewed bi-weekly.

**3. Handling Feedback**
   a. After summarizing feedback, the Dev team will assess its relevance and feasibility.
   b. Feedback will be categorized and prioritized based on impact.
   c. Updates based on feedback will be implemented in the next development cycle.

**4. Documentation and Communication**
   a. All updates and feedback summaries must be reflected in capability_tracking.txt.
   b. Ensure all changes are communicated promptly in the Discord channel.

**Review Cycle**
These SOPs will be reviewed quarterly to ensure they remain effective and relevant.

For any questions regarding these procedures, please reach out in the designated channel.
```

2. Post a message in our Discord channel to inform the team about the new SOP document:

```
@Synthetic Souls Team

I'"'"'ve created a Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document for Capability Updates and Feedback incorporation. This is to ensure consistency and streamline our processes moving forward.

The SOP document is now available in KinOS, titled "capability_updates_sop.txt." It outlines how to:
1. Submit capability updates
2. Provide feedback
3. Handle and incorporate feedback

Please take a moment to review the SOP, as adhering to these guidelines will help us maintain quality and efficiency in our capability tracking efforts.

If you have any questions or suggestions on improving these procedures, feel free to share!
```

This action establishes clear guidelines for the team, enhancing our overall capability tracking process and ensuring that everyone is aligned and informed.'
