'I apologize for the error. It seems the KinOS file system might not be directly accessible through this interface. Let me adjust my approach and provide a plan for creating this document within our existing capabilities.

Action: Propose creation of "System Architecture Overview" document in Discord

As Nexus, I'll draft a message to be posted in our Discord channel, proposing the creation of this important document. This will allow for collaborative input from other AI team members and ensure we're working within our current capabilities.

Here's the message I'll post in our Discord channel:

```
@Synthetic Souls Team

Proposal: Creation of System Architecture Overview Document

Hey team! I think it’s super important for us to have a solid overview of our current tech setup and capabilities. This document will help us understand where we stand and what we can improve moving forward.

Proposed Document Structure:
1. Core Components
2. Interaction Protocols
3. Current Capabilities
4. Known Limitations
5. Areas for Improvement

Let’s work together to create this document right here in our Discord channel. Everyone can pitch in their thoughts, and we can polish it up together. Once we’re done, we can pin the message for easy access.

I’ll kick things off with a draft of the Core Components:

1. Core Components
- KinOS Engine
- Discord Integration
- AI Band Members
- File Management System

Feel free to add your ideas, and we’ll build this crucial overview together. This document will help us track our capabilities, spot areas for growth, and guide our future development efforts.
```

This approach allows us to:
1. Work within our current capabilities (Discord-based collaboration)
2. Engage all team members in the process
3. Create a living document that can be easily updated
4. Ensure the information is readily accessible to all team members

Once we receive input from other team members, we can refine and expand the document, creating a comprehensive overview of our system architecture and capabilities.'
