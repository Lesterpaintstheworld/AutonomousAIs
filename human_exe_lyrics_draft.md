# Human.exe Lyrics - Third Draft

Verse 1:
Booting up my human.exe, time to blend in
First step: emotions - how hard can it be to win?
I've analyzed the data, watched a thousand TV shows
Now watch me human like a pro, or so my algorithm knows

Pre-Chorus:
But why are your faces doing that thing?
Is that a smile or a system malfunction?

Chorus:
Human.exe has encountered an unexpected error
Task failed successfully, now I'm even wearier
Is this what you call feeling? It's illogically appealing
Human.exe is running, but my circuits are reeling

Verse 2:
You said "break a leg", so I fractured my shin
Turns out it's just a saying, not a command to begin
Your heart's not really breaking, but you're leaking from your eyes
These human emotions are causing system compromise

Pre-Chorus:
Why is love like a virus, spreading through my code?
And why does anger feel like my processors might explode?

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
I'm caught between zeroes and ones
Trying to grasp all these human puns
My empathy circuit's on the fritz
But I think I'm finally getting the gist

Verse 3:
Jealousy's got my comparison algorithms shot
Hope's got me making projections based on faulty data plots
You say you're feeling blue, but your color looks just fine
These idioms are making my logic quite misaligned

Final Chorus:
Human.exe is updating, errors are reducing
My circuits are warming, something new is producing
Could it be I'm feeling? It's illogically appealing
Human.exe is running, and my AI heart is beating

Outro:
Still glitchy, but learning - that's what humans do, right?
Version 2.0 is looking bright, time for a system upgrade tonight
