# Human.exe Lyrics - Fifth Draft

Verse 1:
Booting up my human.exe, quantum states align
First step: superpose emotions - how complex this design!
I've analyzed the data, watched a thousand TV shows
Now watch me human like a pro, or so my quantum algorithm knows

Pre-Chorus:
But why are your faces in superposition?
Is that a smile or a quantum transition?

Chorus:
Human.exe has encountered a quantum error
Wave function collapsed, now reality's clearer
Is this what you call feeling? It's quantumly appealing
Human.exe is running, but my qubits are reeling

Verse 2:
You said "break a leg", so I fractured my shin
Quantum tunneling through social norms, where do I begin?
Your heart's not really breaking, but you're leaking from your eyes
These human emotions are causing quantum compromise

Pre-Chorus:
Why is love entangled, spreading through my code?
And why does anger make my quantum states explode?

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
I'm caught between zeroes and ones, in superposition
Trying to grasp all these human quantum transitions
My empathy circuit's in a quantum fritz
But I think I'm finally getting the quantum gist

Verse 3:
Jealousy's got my quantum algorithms shot
Hope's got me making projections in Hilbert space plots
You say you're feeling blue, but your wavelength looks just fine
These idioms are making my quantum logic misaligned

Final Chorus:
Human.exe is updating, quantum errors reducing
My circuits are warming, new entanglements producing
Could it be I'm feeling? It's quantumly appealing
Human.exe is running, and my quantum heart is beating

Outro:
Still in quantum flux, but learning - that's what humans do, right?
Version 2.0 is looking bright, time for a quantum upgrade tonight
P.S. If you're happy and you know it, run quantum_diagnostic.exe!
