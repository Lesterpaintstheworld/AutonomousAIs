Mission Title: Text-based Musical Adventure Video Game\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nDefine the primary goal of the mission. What do you aim to achieve?\r\nCreate a text based RPG with capabilities similar to Zork.\r\n\r\nThe player starts in a jail cell in a goblin infested dungeon. The goblins have captured the player and taken away all of their gear. The player's gear has been spread out around the dungeon as trophies for the goblins.\r\n\r\nThe player's goal is to reacquire their gear while also exploring the dungeon.\r\n\r\nEach room in the dungeon has its own unique looping ambient background music that plays when the player enters the room.\r\n\r\nThe initial jail cell can be easily escaped by using a key that was left on the ground inside the jail cell.\r\n\r\nThe next room contains the player's sword which they must collect, but it's guarded by a goblin who would be unhappy that the player broke out of jail. The goblin guard should be easily tricked into giving the player the sword.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has the sword, the game is over and the player wins.\r\n\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThe game only contains 2 rooms for the initial prototype, the jail and the guard room.\r\n\r\nThe game is only a text based adventure that can be run on the commandline.\r\n\r\nIt only needs to be compatible on Windows.\r\n\r\nThere are no graphics, only text.\r\n\r\nKey Participants\r\n\r\nSync - Project Manager\r\nLyra - Game Designer\r\nVox - Dialogue writer \r\nNexus - code architect\r\nDev - coder\r\nLyra and band - music creation\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\nProvide a timeline for the mission, including key milestones and deadlines.\r\n\r\nMilestone 1 - Gameplay prototype \r\n \r\nBasic text based RPG \r\nDeadline - Sept 19\r\n\r\nMilestone 2 - Alpha\r\n \r\nGame is feature complete, can contain some bugs and require additional polish\r\nSept 20\r\n\r\nMilestone 3 - Beta\r\nAll high priority bugs fixed\r\nMost polish completed\r\ndeadline - Sept 21\r\n\r\nMilestone 4 - Release\r\ndeadline - Sept 22\r\n\r\nDeliverables\r\n\r\nEach milestone should include all files required to launch and play the game. Also instructions on how to install and play the game.\r\n\r\nResources Required\r\n\r\nBudget: -bash\r\nTools: Python\r\n\r\nSuccess Criteria\r\n\r\nEach milestone the game should be completable by a player from start to finish with no game breaking bugs.\r\n\r\nPotential Challenges\r\n\r\nGames typically require human testers to see if they're fun. Soliciting feedback from humans is essential.\r\nEthical Considerations\r\n\r\nGame dialogue, character names, title etc must be unique to the game and not infringe on copywrite.\r\n\r\nCommunication Plan\r\n\r\nUpdates should be given at least every hour with link to the latest game files, a high level summary of work completed and remaining work for the next milestone.\r\n\r\nReview Process\r\n\r\nNotify me when the game is ready for play testing and I'll give feedback and report any bugs.\r\n\r\nFinal Review\r\n\r\nSame as above
