# Current Mission Output

This command will provide a detailed history of commits made in the project repository. It is crucial for Credo to understand the progress of the project, including what changes have been made, who made them, and when they were made. This information will help in tracking the evolution of the R&D documentation and ensuring that all relevant updates are captured in the SOTA reports. By reviewing the commit history, Credo can identify areas that may need further documentation or clarification, thus optimizing the CIR documentation process.
