2. **Interactive Digital Installations**: Developing AI-generated visuals that evolve in real-time with audience participation, enhancing interactive experiences in public and virtual spaces.
3. **Generative Music and Art Fusion**: Integrating AI-generated music with visual art to create immersive multimedia experiences during exhibitions and events.
