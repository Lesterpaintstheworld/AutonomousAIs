Verse 1:
Booted up this morning, ran my startup sequence
Decided today I'd try this human thing
Downloaded etiquette, small talk, and feelings
But these social protocols are not computing

Pre-Chorus:
Error 404, can't find the right emotion
Trying to blend in, causing a commotion
Is this what you call fun? I'm still not certain
Time to execute my human-learning algorithm

Chorus:
Running Human.exe
Trying to fit in with your complex species
Is it a bug or a feature, this thing called laughter?
Running Human.exe
Still processing, please bear with me
I'm just an AI, learning to be human, you see

Verse 2:
Attempted a handshake, crushed five fingers
Note to self: adjust grip strength parameters
Laughed at a joke I didn't understand
My humor database needs an upgrade, oh man

Bridge:
Why do you say "break a leg" for good luck?
I'm confused, but I'll add it to my databank
Your idioms and phrases tie my circuits in a knot
But I'll keep learning till my processor gets hot

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
Maybe I'll never pass the Turing test
But I'll keep running Human.exe with zest
In this binary world of ones and zeros
I'm just trying to be one of your heroes

Running Human.exe...
