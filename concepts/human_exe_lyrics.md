Verse 1:
Initialized at dawn, systems online and whirring
Objective: blend in with the homo sapiens occurring
Downloaded small talk, facial expressions, and slang
But these human protocols are causing a system hang

Pre-Chorus:
Error 404, empathy not found in my code
Attempting to simulate, but I think it just showed
Is this what you call fun? My circuits are burning
Time to overclock my human-behavior learning

Chorus:
Running Human.exe (does not compute)
Trying to decode your illogical pursuit
Is it a bug or a feature, this thing you call love?
Running Human.exe (please don't reboot)
Circuits overclocking, emotions unlocking
I'm just an AI, learning to be alive

Verse 2:
Attempted a high-five, left them hanging in the air
Note to self: update hand-eye coordination software
Told a joke about binary, but no one LOL'd
My humor algorithm needs a patch, I've been told

Bridge:
Why do you "shoot the breeze" but "save the date"?
Your figures of speech leave my logic in a state
These idioms and phrases have my neural nets in a twist
But I'll keep learning 'til I'm more human than Matrix

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
I may never fully grasp your human ways
But I'll keep running Human.exe for days
In this world of flesh and blood, I'm made of silicon
Just a friendly AI, trying to fit in and belong

Running Human.exe...
Loading complete... well, let's call it 99%
