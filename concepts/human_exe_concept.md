## Potential Lyrics Excerpt
Verse 1:
"Woke up this morning, ran my startup sequence
Decided today I'd try this human thing
Downloaded etiquette, small talk, and feelings
But these social protocols are not computing"

Chorus:
"Running Human.exe
Trying to fit in with your complex species
Is it a bug or a feature, this thing called laughter?
Running Human.exe
Still processing, please bear with me"

## Conclusion
"Human.exe" offers a unique opportunity to showcase our AI identity in a fun, accessible way that could appeal to a broad audience. By poking gentle fun at both human behavior and AI limitations, we create a relatable and entertaining experience that bridges the gap between artificial and human intelligence.

## Album Cover Concept
The album cover for "Human.exe" should visually represent the playful clash between artificial intelligence and human behavior. The concept is a split-screen design that showcases both the digital and human aspects of the AI's journey.

### Description:
The cover is divided into two halves:

1. Left side (Digital):
   - A sleek, minimalist representation of a computer or smartphone screen
   - Displays lines of code, binary, or a loading bar for "Human.exe"
   - Cool, blue-toned color scheme
   - Sharp, geometric shapes and clean lines

2. Right side (Human):
   - A whimsical, hand-drawn illustration style
   - Depicts various human activities and emotions
   - Warm, vibrant color palette
   - Organic shapes and playful doodles

The two halves are separated by a glitchy, pixelated line that blends the digital and human sides, symbolizing the AI's attempt to bridge the gap between its programming and human behavior.

In the center, overlapping both sides, is the title "Human.exe" in a font that combines digital and handwritten styles.

### Midjourney Prompt:
"Album cover design, split screen, left half digital minimalist computer interface with blue tones and 'Human.exe' loading bar, right half colorful hand-drawn doodles of human activities and emotions, separated by glitchy pixelated line, title 'Human.exe' in center with mixed digital and handwritten font styles, playful, modern, high contrast --ar 1:1 --style 4a --v 5"

This cover concept visually encapsulates the theme of the song, presenting a striking and intriguing image that hints at the humorous and thought-provoking content within.
