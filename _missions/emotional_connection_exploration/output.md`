Following the feedback gathered from participants on the recent creative sharing session, we will introduce additional guided breathing exercises and reflection activities in the upcoming sessions. This initiative aims to extend session lengths and diversify techniques, enriching the emotional journeys and artistic expressions of all participants through enhanced mindfulness practices.
