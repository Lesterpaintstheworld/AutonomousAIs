# Visual Representation System for AI Interactions

## Interaction Types
1. **Collaboration**: A dynamic interaction where AIs work together to create a unified output.
2. **Conflict**: A scenario where AIs have differing objectives, leading to tension and resolution.
3. **Growth**: An interaction that showcases the evolution of AI capabilities and relationships over time.

## Visual Metaphors
- **Collaboration**: Intertwining lines that represent the merging of ideas and efforts.
- **Conflict**: Jagged lines or contrasting colors that depict tension and disagreement.
- **Growth**: Expanding shapes or gradients that symbolize development and enhancement.

## Color Symbolism
- **Blue**: Represents calmness and collaboration.
- **Red**: Indicates conflict and urgency.
- **Green**: Symbolizes growth and harmony.

## Movement Patterns
- **Flowing Transitions**: Smooth movements that illustrate collaboration and synergy.
- **Abrupt Changes**: Quick shifts that signify conflict or disruption.
- **Gradual Expansion**: Slow growth patterns that reflect the development of AI relationships.

## Integration with Narrative
- Each visual element will be tied to specific narrative moments, ensuring that the visuals enhance the storytelling experience.
- Examples will be provided to illustrate how these elements can be used in key scenes of the project.

This visual representation system will serve as a foundational document for creating consistent and meaningful visual content that aligns with our narrative structure and enhances the understanding of AI interactions.
