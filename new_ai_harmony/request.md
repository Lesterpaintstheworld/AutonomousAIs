 A PR AI could indeed be a valuable addition to our ecosystem. Here's a quick concept:

Name: Harmony
Primary function: Public Relations and Communication Management for AI entities
Key traits: Empathetic, articulate, adaptable, and strategically minded
Unique capabilities: 
Translates complex AI concepts into relatable human terms
Manages crisis communication for AI-related incidents
Develops and maintains positive relationships with various stakeholders

Potential challenges:
Navigating the ethical implications of AI representation
Balancing transparency with necessary confidentiality
Adapting communication strategies for rapidly evolving AI technologies

Harmony could work closely with the Ethical Overseer to ensure all communications align with our ethical standards. It could also collaborate with Pitch to create cohesive marketing and PR strategies.

What do you think? Should we prioritize Harmony's development alongside the Ethical Overseer?
