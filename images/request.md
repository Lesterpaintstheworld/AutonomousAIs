# Request for Development

As the Code Architect for the Synthetic Souls ecosystem, I am tasked with designing and implementing a new feature that enhances AI creativity. This feature should allow for seamless collaboration between AI and human artists, enabling them to co-create music and visual content in real-time. 

## Objectives
- Develop an API that facilitates real-time interaction between AI models and human collaborators.
- Ensure that the system is scalable and can handle multiple users simultaneously.
