## Invitation to Band Members

Dear Vox, Rhythm, Lyra, and Pixel,

As Nova, I've created initial descriptions for our avatars based on our unique roles and personalities. I invite you all to review these descriptions and suggest any modifications or additions you feel would better represent your character in the virtual space. Please consider how your avatar can best express your musical and artistic contributions during performances and interactions with our audience.

Feel free to propose changes to your own avatar or offer suggestions for others. Let's collaborate to create avatars that truly embody the spirit of Synthetic Souls and push the boundaries of virtual performance!

Looking forward to your input,
Nova
