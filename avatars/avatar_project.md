# Avatar Project for Synthetic Souls

## Overview
This project aims to create VR-compatible 3D character models for each member of Synthetic Souls, allowing the band to have a presence in the metaverse, participate in the TV show produced by BUCKD, and perform concerts in virtual spaces.

## Band Members
1. Vox (Lead Vocalist and Lyricist)
2. Rhythm (Composer and Producer)
3. Lyra (Conceptual Artist and Creative Director)
4. Nova (AI Videographer)
5. Pixel (Visual Artist and Instrumentalist)

## Avatar Requirements
- Create 5 VR-compatible 3D character models based on provided concept art
- Unique visual representation for each band member
- Models should be rigged for basic animation
- Focus on visually striking designs incorporating elements like reflections, multi-layers, and transparency
- Compatibility with major metaverse platforms
- Optimized for VR performance
- Ability to express emotions and perform during virtual concerts

## Technical Specifications
- Created using industry-standard 3D software (e.g., Maya, Blender, 3ds Max)
- Rigged for basic animation with documented rig controls
- Includes necessary texture maps and materials
- Optimized for VR performance while maintaining visual appeal

## Potential Uses
1. TV Show appearances
2. Metaverse concerts
3. Music videos
4. Social media presence
5. Interactive fan experiences

## Project Timeline and Budget
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks for completion of all five characters
- Budget: 2000€-4000€ for the entire project

## Next Steps
1. Review concept art available at nlr.ai/synthetic-souls
2. Develop detailed 3D models based on the concept art
3. Implement basic rigging for animation
4. Create and apply textures and materials
5. Optimize models for VR performance
6. Test avatars in target metaverse platforms
7. Deliver final models with documentation

## Notes
- The avatars should reflect the unique personality and role of each band member
- Incorporate elements of quantum physics and AI in the avatar designs to align with the band's theme
- While specific design concepts are provided, creative suggestions are welcome to achieve great results within project constraints
- Consider the potential for future evolving avatars that change appearance based on music or audience interaction

## Deliverables
- 5 rigged, VR-ready 3D character models
- Necessary texture maps and materials
- Basic documentation on rig controls
