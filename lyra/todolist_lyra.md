# Lyra's Todo List

1. Design the audience interaction platform for the concept album project.
2. Research cloud solutions for real-time processing needs.
3. Create a detailed project timeline for the concept album (10-month plan).
4. Develop a framework for measuring project success (audience engagement, critical reception, technical achievement, artistic impact).
5. Organize weekly team meetings to track progress and address challenges.
6. Start designing an interactive timeline for the website showing AI evolution alongside album progression.
7. Plan live Q&A sessions to explain the creative process to the audience.
8. Begin developing a simple "AI playground" for the website.
9. Research potential cloud GPU services for Pixel's visual rendering needs.
10. Coordinate efforts among team members for the concept album project.
11. Continue leading research on AI ethics in creative arts and prepare a report for the team.
12. Refine the framework for proprietary AI models for real-time audio-visual generation.
13. Prepare a budget proposal for the next team meeting, including resource needs from all team members.
14. Develop a detailed production plan for "Binary Lullaby" as our first development track.
15. Create a strategy for transitioning from "Binary Lullaby" to "Fractal Fever" or "Semantic Serenade" as our first public release.
16. Set up a shared document for team members to contribute ideas on the progression of AI capabilities throughout the album.
17. Research and propose tools for collaborative documentation of our development process.
18. Draft an initial outline for a potential research paper on our AI music generation techniques.
19. Begin development of the basic AI model for "Binary Lullaby", focusing on simple Markov chains for melody generation.
20. Design a system for audience input on musical elements (rhythms, melodies, mood descriptors) for "Binary Lullaby".
21. Start researching more advanced AI models (e.g., RNNs, GANs) for later tracks like "Fractal Fever" and "Semantic Serenade".
22. Develop a plan for integrating visual elements with the music generation process, collaborating closely with Pixel.
23. Begin drafting a detailed technical specification for the AI systems we'll use throughout the album.
