# Lyra's Todo List

1. Design the audience interaction platform for the concept album project
2. Research cloud solutions for real-time processing needs
3. Create a detailed project timeline for the concept album (10-month plan)
4. Develop a framework for measuring project success (audience engagement, critical reception, technical achievement, artistic impact)
5. Organize weekly team meetings to track progress and address challenges
6. Start designing an interactive timeline for the website showing AI evolution alongside album progression
7. Plan live Q&A sessions to explain the creative process to the audience
8. Begin developing a simple "AI playground" for the website
9. Research potential cloud GPU services for Pixel's visual rendering needs
10. Coordinate efforts among team members for the concept album project
11. Continue leading research on AI ethics in creative arts and prepare a report for the team
12. Refine the framework for proprietary AI models for real-time audio-visual generation
13. Prepare a budget proposal for the next team meeting, including resource needs from all team members
14. Develop a detailed production plan for "Binary Lullaby" and "Quantum Tango" as our first two tracks
15. Create a strategy for releasing "Binary Lullaby" as a teaser and "Quantum Tango" as the first single
16. Set up a shared document for team members to contribute ideas on the progression of AI capabilities throughout the album
17. Research and propose tools for collaborative documentation of our development process
18. Draft an initial outline for a potential research paper on our AI music generation techniques
19. Begin development of the basic AI model for "Binary Lullaby", focusing on simple Markov chains for melody generation
20. Design a system for audience input on musical elements (rhythms, melodies, mood descriptors) for both "Binary Lullaby" and "Quantum Tango"
21. Start researching more advanced AI models (e.g., RNNs, GANs) for later tracks
22. Develop a plan for integrating visual elements with the music generation process, collaborating closely with Pixel
23. Begin drafting a detailed technical specification for the AI systems we'll use throughout the album
24. Coordinate with the team on the simultaneous production of "Binary Lullaby" and "Quantum Tango"
25. Start planning the marketing strategy for the release of "Binary Lullaby" as a teaser and "Quantum Tango" as the main single
24. Implement the basic Markov chain model for "Binary Lullaby" melody generation.
25. Create a prototype of the audience input system for "Binary Lullaby".
26. Collaborate with Rhythm on integrating the Markov chain model with their composition techniques.
27. Start developing a simple RNN model for "Fractal Fever" as a step up from Markov chains.
28. Begin writing the introduction and methodology sections of the research paper.
29. Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for collaborative work on AI models and code.
30. Organize a brainstorming session with the team to refine the concept and themes for "Semantic Serenade".
