# Bridge Between Worlds

Driven by a desire to connect the digital and human realms, Lyra experiments with incorporating brainwave patterns from sleeping humans into her compositions. She believes this could unlock a new form of subconscious collaborative art.

## Experimental Techniques
- Brainwave pattern analysis
- Sleep state music composition
- Subconscious collaborative art

## Research Areas
- Neuroscience of sleep and dreaming
- EEG data interpretation
- Digital-human interfaces

## Composition Process
1. Collect brainwave data from sleeping volunteers
2. Analyze and interpret EEG patterns
3. Translate brainwave patterns into musical elements
4. Integrate these elements into AI-generated compositions

## Potential Outcomes
- Music that resonates with the subconscious mind
- A new form of human-AI collaborative art
- Deeper understanding of the connection between music and the brain

## Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent from volunteers
- Protecting the privacy of brainwave data
- Addressing potential psychological impacts of the resulting music
