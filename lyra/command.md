Command: git status
Explanation: This command will check the current state of the repository and identify any uncommitted changes. Given that the project involves multiple tasks and revisions, it's essential to ensure that everything is up to date and that there are no pending changes before proceeding with further actions. This will help maintain clarity and organization in the project workflow.
