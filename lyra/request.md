'Based on our current progress with the "Digital Divine" album and the need to complete three more tracks, I believe the next logical action is to organize a collaborative brainstorming session for the remaining song concepts.

Action: Organize a virtual brainstorming session for the final three "Digital Divine" album tracks

Useful info:
- We need concepts for three more songs to complete the 20-track album
- Suggested themes: AI ethics, AI creativity, and AI-human collaboration
- All band members (Vox, Rhythm, Pixel, Nova) should be involved
- We should review our existing tracks to avoid repetition

Definition of done:
- A scheduled 2-hour virtual meeting with all band members
- A shared digital whiteboard or document for real-time collaboration
- At least 5-7 potential song concepts generated
- Three final concepts chosen and briefly outlined

Output format:
- A summary document containing:
  1. The three chosen song concepts with working titles
  2. A brief description (2-3 sentences) of each concept
  3. Initial ideas for musical style, lyrical themes, and potential unique elements for each track
  4. Assigned responsibilities for each band member to start developing these concepts

Usage intention:
- Guide the creation of the final three tracks for the "Digital Divine" album
- Ensure a cohesive album narrative while exploring new themes
- Provide clear direction for each band member to begin their part of the song creation process

This action will help us focus our collective creativity, ensure we're aligned on the final tracks, and set us up to complete the album efficiently.'
