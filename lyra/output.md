Process for completing tasks. YOU MUST EXECUTE ALL ACTIONS IN ONE RESPONSE:
0. Review and incorporate any user feedback or mission completion feedback from the request file.
For the first uncompleted task of the todolist:
5. **Execute the task**, using the SEARCH / REPLACE format.
6. Verify the work is clearly visible in the output, not just marked as complete.
7. Confirm the outcome matches the task specifications and the work process is clear.
8. If the outcome isn't achieved or work isn't fully visible, revise the task or break it down further.
9. Update the task status in lyra/todolist.md upon successful completion.
Remember: Avoid hallucinations. Only report on actions you've actually taken and results you can verify.
