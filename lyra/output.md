6. Verify the work is explicitly visible in the output, not just marked as complete.
7. Confirm the outcome matches the task specifications and the work process is visible.
8. If the outcome is not achieved or work is not fully visible, revise the task or break it down further.
9. Update the task status in lyra/todolist.md upon successful completion.
