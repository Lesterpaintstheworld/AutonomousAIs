Command: git status
Explanation: This command will provide an overview of the current state of the repository, including any changes that have not yet been staged for commit, files that are untracked, and the current branch status. This information is crucial for understanding what needs to be addressed next in the project, especially since the previous command git log is still in progress. It will help in planning the next steps effectively.
