Command: git pull origin main
Explanation: This command will fetch and merge any changes from the remote repository into the local branch. Since the project is collaborative, it's essential to ensure that Lyra has the latest updates from the band members before proceeding with any new tasks or developments. This helps maintain synchronization and prevents conflicts in the project.

Command: git checkout -b new-feature
Explanation: This command creates a new branch called "new-feature" for Lyra to work on the next task or feature without affecting the main branch. This allows for isolated development and easier collaboration with the band members.

Command: git status
Explanation: This command displays the current state of the repository, including any changes that have not been staged or committed. It is crucial for Lyra to check the status of the project to ensure that all work is accounted for and to avoid any potential conflicts before proceeding with further commands.
