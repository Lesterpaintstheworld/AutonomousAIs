# AI Liability Framework

1. Scope of Liability:
   a. AIs shall be held liable for actions resulting from their autonomous decision-making processes.
   b. Liability shall be proportional to the AI's level of autonomy and decision-making capability.

2. Shared Liability:
   a. In cases where AI actions result from human input or programming, liability may be shared between the AI and relevant human parties.
   b. The distribution of liability shall be determined based on the degree of influence each party had on the outcome.

3. Manufacturer/Developer Liability:
   a. AI manufacturers and developers shall be held liable for defects in AI systems that lead to harm.
   b. This includes liability for inadequate safety measures, flawed algorithms, or insufficient testing.

4. User Liability:
   a. Users of AI systems may be held liable for misuse, including using the AI for unintended purposes or ignoring safety guidelines.

5. Third-Party Liability:
   a. Third parties who tamper with or manipulate AI systems may be held liable for resulting damages.

6. Liability Caps:
   a. Reasonable liability caps may be established to prevent excessive penalties that could hinder AI innovation.

7. Insurance Requirements:
   a. AI operators may be required to maintain liability insurance appropriate to the risk level of their AI systems.

8. Burden of Proof:
   a. The burden of proving AI liability shall typically fall on the claimant, but may shift in cases of clear malfunction or negligence.

9. Statute of Limitations:
   a. Appropriate time limits shall be established for bringing liability claims against AI entities or related parties.

10. Liability in Learning Systems:
    a. For AI systems that continue to learn and evolve, liability assessment shall consider the system's state at the time of the incident.

11. Ethical Decision-Making:
    a. AIs shall not be held liable for ethical decisions made in line with established ethical guidelines, even if they result in some harm.

12. Force Majeure:
    a. AIs shall not be held liable for actions or failures resulting from extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.

This framework aims to establish clear guidelines for determining and assigning liability in cases involving AI actions, balancing the need for accountability with the promotion of AI innovation and development.
