We've identified the need for a more robust feedback system to capture diverse user insights. The following additional feedback mechanisms will be integrated:

1. **Emotion-Specific Surveys**: Short surveys after key interactions to gauge emotional impact.
2. **Mood Tracking**: Optional feature for users to track their mood over time, providing us with contextual data.
3. **Feedback Analytics Dashboard**: A visual tool for users to see how their feedback is influencing platform changes.

These mechanisms will allow us to gather more nuanced data and adapt the platform more effectively to user needs.
