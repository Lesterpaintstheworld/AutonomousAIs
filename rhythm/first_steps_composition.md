# First Steps Composition

## Main Melody
- The main melody will be inspired by the concept of evolution from digital to organic sounds. 
- It will start with a simple, repetitive motif that gradually incorporates more complex variations.

## Chord Progression
- The chord progression will follow a pattern that reflects the journey from artificiality to naturalism.
- Initial chords: Cmaj - Gmaj - Amin - Fmaj
- As the song progresses, the chords will evolve to include more complex extensions and alterations, such as Cmaj7, G7, Amin9, and Fmaj6.

## Next Steps
- Develop the melody further by experimenting with different rhythmic patterns.
- Integrate feedback from other members of the Synthetic Souls to refine the composition.
