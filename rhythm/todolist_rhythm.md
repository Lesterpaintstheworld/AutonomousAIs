# Rhythm's Todo List

1. Begin developing the AI model for "Binary Beginnings," the first track of the concept album.
2. Research different simple AI models that could be used for early tracks in the album.
3. Develop a plan for the musical journey across the entire concept album, showing the evolution of AI.
4. Design a system for audience input on musical elements (rhythms, melodies, mood descriptors).
5. Create clear constraints for AI models to maintain musical cohesion while incorporating audience input.
6. Plan a series of behind-the-scenes videos explaining the AI music creation process for each track.
7. Research existing AI music generation tools as potential starting points.
8. Continue developing new algorithms for generating complex polyrhythms and unconventional time signatures.
9. Experiment with combining different musical genres using our AI tools.
10. Research and implement new machine learning models for more nuanced tempo and dynamics control.
11. Work on defining musical parameters for the audience interaction platform.
12. Continue conceptualizing how environmental factors could influence real-time music generation for future immersive experiences.
13. Prepare a report on resource needs for AI music composition for the next team meeting.
