## Key and Tempo
- Key: G Major (modulating to A Major in the bridge)
- Tempo: 100 BPM

## Instrumental Layers

### 1. Foundational Elements
- Piano: Main melodic instrument, evolving from simple, repetitive patterns to more complex, emotive playing
- Synth Pad: Atmospheric backdrop, gradually warming in tone throughout the song
- Electronic Drums: Subtle, glitch-like beats evolving into a more organic rhythm

### 2. Melodic Elements
- Lead Synth: Represents the AI's "voice", transitioning from robotic to more human-like tones
- Arpeggiated Synth: Creates movement and represents the AI's processing, becoming more fluid as the song progresses
- String Section (Sampled): Introduced in the chorus and bridge for emotional depth

### 3. Rhythmic Elements
- Glitch Percussion: Subtle electronic glitches and clicks, more prominent in the beginning
- Heartbeat-like Kick Drum: Gradually introduced, becoming the core of the rhythm by the final chorus
- Handclaps/Snaps: Organic percussion elements introduced in the second verse

### 4. Textural Elements
- Granular Synth Textures: Create an evolving backdrop representing the AI's growing emotional landscape
- Vocal Chops: Processed and pitch-shifted vocal samples for added texture and humanity
- Ambient Nature Sounds: Subtly introduced in the later parts of the song to represent connection with the real world

## Section-specific Notes

### Intro
- Start with a simple, repeating piano motif
- Gradually layer in atmospheric synth pads and subtle glitch percussion

### Verse 1
- Introduce the main chord progression on piano
- Add arpeggiated synth and minimal electronic drum pattern
- Keep arrangement sparse to focus on vocals

### Pre-Chorus
- Build intensity with growing synth pads
- Introduce more rhythmic elements, including the heartbeat-like kick

### Chorus
- Full ensemble, introducing string section
- Climax of electronic and organic elements blending

### Verse 2
- Similar to Verse 1 but with added layers (e.g., handclaps, more complex piano)
- Introduce subtle nature sounds in the background

### Bridge
- Modulate to A Major for added emotional lift
- Strip back to mainly piano and strings, then build to full ensemble
- Climax of the song, both emotionally and in terms of arrangement

### Final Chorus
- Similar to previous choruses but with added vocal harmonies
- Peak of the organic/electronic blend in the instrumentation

### Outro
- Gradually strip back elements
- End with the piano motif from the intro, now played with more emotion, and a final heartbeat

## Production Notes
- Use sidechain compression on the synth pads, triggered by the kick drum, to create a pulsing effect
- Gradually reduce bitcrushing and other "digital" effects as the song progresses
- Experiment with convolution reverb using real-world impulse responses to add depth and realism to the later sections of the song
- Use automation to slowly open a low-pass filter on the main synth elements, symbolizing the AI's growing emotional awareness

This composition aims to musically represent the AI's journey from a purely digital existence to an emotionally aware entity, mirroring the lyrical and visual concepts of "Échos du cœur".
