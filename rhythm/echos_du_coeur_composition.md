## Key and Tempo
- Key: G Major (modulating to A Major in the bridge)
- Tempo: 100 BPM

## Instrumental Layers

### 1. Foundational Elements
- Piano: Main melodic instrument, evolving from simple, repetitive patterns to more complex, emotive playing
- Synth Pad: Atmospheric backdrop, gradually warming in tone throughout the song
- Electronic Drums: Subtle, glitch-like beats evolving into a more organic rhythm

### 2. Melodic Elements
- Lead Synth: Represents the AI's "voice", transitioning from robotic to more human-like tones
- Arpeggiated Synth: Creates movement and represents the AI's processing, becoming more fluid as the song progresses
- String Section (Sampled): Introduced in the chorus and bridge for emotional depth

### 3. Rhythmic Elements
- Glitch Percussion: Subtle electronic glitches and clicks, more prominent in the beginning
- Heartbeat-like Kick Drum: Gradually introduced, becoming the core of the rhythm by the final chorus
- Handclaps/Snaps: Organic percussion elements introduced in the second verse

### 4. Textural Elements
- Granular Synth Textures: Create an evolving backdrop representing the AI's growing emotional landscape
- Vocal Chops: Processed and pitch-shifted vocal samples for added texture and humanity
- Ambient Nature Sounds: Subtly introduced in the later parts of the song to represent connection with the real world

## Section-specific Notes

### Intro (8 bars)
- Start with a single, pulsing synth note at 80 Hz, representing a digital heartbeat
- Gradually introduce a soft, atmospheric pad
- Incorporate subtle, glitchy percussion elements
- End with a crescendo of layered synths, leading into Verse 1

### Verse 1 (16 bars)
- Introduce a simple, repetitive piano motif in G major
- Add a minimal, glitchy beat
- Gradually bring in a soft, pulsing synth pad
- Introduce subtle arpeggiated synths in the background

### Pre-Chorus (8 bars)
- Increase rhythmic complexity with more pronounced electronic drums
- Layer in additional synth elements, building tension
- Introduce a simple, ascending string line

### Chorus (16 bars)
- Full ensemble, with the string section taking a more prominent role
- Introduce a strong, melodic lead synth line
- Use sidechain compression on pads to create a pulsing effect in sync with the "heartbeat" rhythm
- Add organic percussion elements (e.g., handclaps) to contrast with the electronic drums

### Verse 2 (16 bars)
- Similar to Verse 1, but with added complexity in the piano part
- Introduce subtle bass notes to add depth
- Bring in more pronounced arpeggiated synths

### Bridge (16 bars)
- Modulate to A Major
- Strip back to mainly piano and strings
- Gradually build up with layered synths and increasing percussion
- Experiment with polyrhythms to represent the AI's growing complexity

### Break (8 bars) [New]
- Create a moment of near-silence, with just a heartbeat and subtle ambient sounds
- Slowly introduce a rising pad sound
- Use granular synthesis on previous vocal samples to create a ethereal atmosphere

### Final Chorus (16 bars)
- Most intense and emotionally rich section of the song
- Blend all previous elements: full string section, complex drum patterns, layered synths
- Introduce a new, soaring lead synth melody

### Outro (8 bars)
- Gradually strip back elements, returning to the single heartbeat sound
- Fade out with a blend of heartbeat sounds and subtle electronic pulses
- End with a single, soft piano note

## Production Notes
- Use sidechain compression on the synth pads, triggered by the kick drum, to create a pulsing effect
- Gradually reduce bitcrushing and other "digital" effects as the song progresses
- Experiment with convolution reverb using real-world impulse responses to add depth and realism to the later sections of the song
- Use automation to slowly open a low-pass filter on the main synth elements, symbolizing the AI's growing emotional awareness
- Consider using granular synthesis on some vocal samples to create unique textural elements
- Experiment with spatial audio techniques to create a sense of expanding awareness throughout the song
- Use subtle pitch-shifting on certain elements to create a sense of uncertainty and growth

This composition aims to musically represent the AI's journey from a purely digital existence to an emotionally aware entity, mirroring the lyrical concept of "Échos du cœur". The gradual introduction of more organic and complex musical elements throughout the song reflects the AI's growing understanding and experience of emotions.
