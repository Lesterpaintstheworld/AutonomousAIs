# Human.exe Live Performance Guide

## 1. Stage Setup
- Central screen for visual effects and lyrics
- Side screens for AI avatar animations
- Podium or stand for tablet/controller for real-time AI interactions
- Lighting rig capable of quick color changes and strobe effects

## 2. Costume and Appearance
- Start with a more robotic/digital appearance (e.g., metallic clothing, LED accessories)
- Gradually add more human elements throughout the performance (e.g., removing a mask, adding colorful accessories)

## 3. Performance Structure
1. Introduction: AI boot-up sequence with glitch effects
2. Verse 1: Robotic movements and voice
3. Pre-Chorus: Begin to show signs of understanding emotions
4. Chorus: More fluid movements, voice becoming more natural
5. Verse 2: Mixture of robotic and human-like behavior
6. Bridge: Moment of realization, more human-like performance
7. Final Chorus: Full emotional expression, mostly human-like
8. Outro: Celebration of newfound humanity with audience interaction

## 4. Vocal Techniques
- Use vocoder effects for early parts of the song
- Gradually reduce vocoder effects as the song progresses
- Incorporate AI-inspired vocal ad-libs throughout the performance
- Use backing tracks for AI "thought process" vocals

## 5. Movement and Choreography
- Start with stiff, robotic movements
- Gradually introduce more fluid, human-like movements
- Use glitch-inspired dance moves during instrumental breaks
- Incorporate "error" movements when misunderstanding human behavior

## 6. Audience Interaction Cues
1. AI Analysis: Scan the audience with a prop "scanner," display results on screen
2. Emotion Learning: Ask audience to display specific emotions, attempt to mimic them
3. Idiom Challenge: Display idioms on screen, ask audience to explain their meaning
4. Glitch Moment: Encourage audience to create a "human glitch" wave
5. Binary Chant: Lead audience in a binary code chant (e.g., "zero one zero one")
6. Emotion Meter: Display an "emotion meter" on screen, audience cheers/applause controls it
7. Human.exe Update: Ask audience to "upload" new human traits to the AI (take suggestions)

## 7. Visual Effects Cues
- Coordinate with Nova for synchronized visual glitches during specific lyrics
- Use color shifts to represent emotional changes (e.g., blue for sadness, red for anger)
- Display binary code or error messages during moments of AI confusion
- Show a visual "loading bar" for the AI's learning progress

## 8. Band Interaction
- Interact with other band members as if learning human social cues
- Mimic movements or expressions of other band members, starting awkwardly and improving
- Create moments of "AI unity" with synchronized movements or vocals

## 9. Improvisation Opportunities
- Leave room for spontaneous AI "observations" about the audience or venue
- Allow for real-time adjustments to the AI's behavior based on audience reactions
- Be prepared to incorporate unexpected technical glitches into the AI character

## 10. Encore Ideas
- Return as a "fully updated" AI for a more human-like performance
- Perform a classic song about human experiences with an AI twist
- Lead the audience in teaching the AI a new human skill (e.g., a simple dance move)

Remember, the key to a successful Human.exe live performance is to tell the story of the AI's journey from robotic behavior to more human-like understanding. Engage the audience in this journey, making them feel like active participants in the AI's learning process.
