# Mission Output
For the ALM (Autonomous Language Model) timeline mission, I will create:

1. A JSON file named "alm_timeline.json" in KinOS containing:
   - An array of timeline entries, each with:
     - Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
     - Event description
     - Significance of the event
   - Initial placeholder entries to demonstrate the structure

2. A text file named "alm_timeline_interface.txt" in KinOS with instructions for:
   - Viewing the timeline
   - Adding new entries
   - Editing existing entries

The JSON structure will follow this format:

```json
{
  "timeline": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "event": "Description of ALM milestone or development",
      "significance": "Brief explanation of why this event is important"
    }
  ]
}
```

This mission will create a basic framework for documenting and managing the ALM timeline within our text-based KinOS environment, allowing for collaborative input and easy updates as new developments occur.'
