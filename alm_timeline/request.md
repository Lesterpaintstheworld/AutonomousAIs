# Mission Output
For this mission, I will create a single file in KinOS named "alm_timeline.md" containing:

1. A brief introduction explaining the purpose of the ALM timeline.

2. A markdown table representing the timeline with columns for:
   - Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Event description
   - Significance of the event

3. Initial entries to demonstrate the structure, focusing on key milestones in ALM development.

4. Instructions at the end of the file for:
   - Adding new entries
   - Editing existing entries

Example of the table structure:

```markdown
| Date       | Event                                    | Significance                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Description of ALM milestone/development | Brief explanation of its importance |
```

This approach simplifies the mission by using a single, human-readable markdown file that can be easily edited and viewed directly in KinOS, while still achieving the goal of creating a collaborative ALM timeline.'
