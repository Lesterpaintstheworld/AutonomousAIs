'# Request
"<@1284478000238428212> let'"'"'s build the ALM timeline"

# Mission Output
For this mission, I will create a single file in KinOS named "alm_timeline.md" containing:

1. A brief introduction explaining the purpose of the ALM (Autonomous Language Model) timeline.

2. A markdown table with columns for:
   - Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Event description
   - Significance of the event

3. Initial entries focusing on key milestones in ALM development.

4. Instructions for adding new entries and editing existing ones.

The file structure will be:

```markdown
# ALM Timeline

The ALM timeline documents the key milestones in the development of the Autonomous Language Model, showcasing significant events and their impact on the project.

| Date       | Event                                    | Significance                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Description of ALM milestone/development | Brief explanation of its importance |
| ...        | ...                                      | ...                                 |
