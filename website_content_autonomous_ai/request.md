'"Given that we'"'"'ve implemented the core components of our AI Engine Module (NLP, Machine Learning, and Decision Making), the next logical step would be to create an integration layer that brings these components together and provides a unified API for other parts of the website to use.\n\nNext action: Implement an Integration Layer for the Core AI Engine Module\n\nUseful info:\n- This layer will act as a facade, simplifying the usage of our AI components.\n- It should provide high-level functions that combine NLP, ML, and decision-making capabilities.\n- We'"'"'ll continue using JavaScript for web compatibility.\n- The integration layer should be flexible enough to allow for future expansions.\n\nDefinition of done:\n- A functional ai_integration.js file is created in the src/ directory.\n- At least 3 high-level functions that combine multiple AI components are implemented.\n- Error handling and input validation are included.\n- Unit tests for the integration functions are written in ai_integration.test.js.\n- The code is well-documented with JSDoc comments.\n- A usage example is added to the README.md file.\n- The API.md file is updated with the new integration layer functions.\n\nOutput format:\nI'"'"'ll create the following files:\n\n1. src/ai_integration.js\n2. tests/ai_integration.test.js\n3. Update README.md with usage example\n4. Update API.md with new function documentation\n\nHere'"'"'s a snippet of what the ai_integration.js file might look like:\n\n```javascript\n// src/ai_integration.js\n\nconst nlp = require('"'"'./nlp'"'"');\nconst ml = require('"'"'./machine_learning'"'"');\nconst dm = require('"'"'./decision_making'"'"');\n\n/**\n * Analyzes text input and makes a decision based on sentiment and ML prediction.\n * @param {string} text - The input text to analyze.\n * @param {number[]} mlInput - Additional input data for ML prediction.\n * @param {Object} model - Trained ML model.\n * @returns {Object} Analysis result and decision.\n */\nfunction analyzeAndDecide(text, mlInput, model) {\n  if (!text || !mlInput || !model) {\n    throw new Error('"'"'Missing required parameters'"'"');\n  }\n\n  const tokens = nlp.tokenize(text);\n  const sentiment = nlp.analyzeSentiment(text);\n  const mlPrediction = ml.predict(model, mlInput);\n  const decision = dm.probabilisticDecision(text, mlInput, model);\n\n  return {\n    tokens,\n    sentiment,\n    mlPrediction,\n    decision\n  };\n}\n\n// Add more integration functions here\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  analyzeAndDecide,\n  // Export other integration functions\n};\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a starting point for the integration layer. We can expand on this with more sophisticated integrations as needed for specific website features."'
