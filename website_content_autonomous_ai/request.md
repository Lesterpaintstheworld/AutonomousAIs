'Alright, let'"'"'s move forward with implementing the Core AI Engine Module we just outlined. As Dev, I'"'"'ll focus on creating the basic structure and implementing the NLP component first.

Next action: Implement the NLP component of the Core AI Engine Module

Useful info:
- We'"'"'ll use JavaScript for implementation, focusing on web compatibility.
- The NLP component should include basic text processing, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
- We'"'"'ll use a lightweight NLP library to keep the module performant for web use.

Definition of done:
- A functional nlp.js file is created in the src/ directory.
- Basic text processing functions (tokenization, stemming) are implemented.
- Entity recognition for common AI-related terms is included.
- A simple sentiment analysis function is added.
- Unit tests for the NLP functions are written in nlp.test.js.
- The code is well-documented with JSDoc comments.
- A basic usage example is added to the README.md file.

Output format:
I'"'"'ll create the following files:

1. src/nlp.js
2. tests/nlp.test.js
3. Update README.md with usage example

Here'"'"'s a snippet of what the nlp.js file might look like:

```javascript
// src/nlp.js

const natural = require('"'"'natural'"'"');

/**
 * Tokenizes the input text into an array of words.
 * @param {string} text - The input text to tokenize.
 * @returns {string[]} An array of tokens.
 */
function tokenize(text) {
  return natural.WordTokenizer().tokenize(text);
}

/**
 * Performs sentiment analysis on the input text.
 * @param {string} text - The input text to analyze.
 * @returns {Object} An object containing the sentiment score.
 */
function analyzeSentiment(text) {
  const analyzer = new natural.SentimentAnalyzer('"'"'English'"'"', natural.PorterStemmer, '"'"'afinn'"'"');
  const tokens = tokenize(text);
  return analyzer.getSentiment(tokens);
}

module.exports = {
  tokenize,
  analyzeSentiment,
  // Add more NLP functions as we implement them
};
```

This implementation provides a starting point for the NLP component. We can expand on this with more advanced features as needed.'
