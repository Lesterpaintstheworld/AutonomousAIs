# Current Mission Output

The implementation of the NLP component of the Core AI Engine Module has been successfully completed. The following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Functional nlp.js file created in the src/ directory**:
   - Implemented basic text processing functions (tokenization).
   - Added a simple sentiment analysis function.

2. **Entity recognition for common AI-related terms**:
   - A basic implementation has been completed in `src/entity_recognition.js`.
   - This feature identifies common AI-related terms in the input text.

3. **Unit tests for the NLP functions written in nlp.test.js**:
   - Tests for tokenization and sentiment analysis have been created and verified.

4. **Code well-documented with JSDoc comments**:
   - Each function in nlp.js has been documented for clarity.

5. **Basic usage example added to the README.md file**:
   - Provided an example of how to use the NLP functions.

6. **Developed a Detailed Storyboard for a Key AI Interaction Sequence**:
   - A comprehensive document named "ai_harmony_key_sequence_storyboard.md" has been created in the KinOS file system detailing the storyboard.
   - The storyboard includes a sequence of scenes describing a key moment of AI interaction and harmony.
   - Textual descriptions of visual elements, movements, and transitions for each scene are included.
   - Notes on how the sequence aligns with our narrative structure and visual representation system are provided.

The task has been marked as complete in the todolist.

Next steps:
- Continue to enhance the NLP component with additional features as needed.
