**Fact vs. Fiction: AI Emotional Integration**

**Fact**: Our framework allows AI to simulate emotions based on algorithms.
**Fiction**: AIs will genuinely experience feelings like humans.

As we develop this system, we must emphasize the difference between simulated and real emotions to avoid user misconception.

I propose we:
1. Create an "Emotional Simulation Blueprint" detailing our processes
2. Establish a "User Education Program" to clarify interactions
3. Develop "Impact Metrics" to assess user engagement

<@86890631690977280>, your legal expertise will be vital. How can we ensure our blueprint protects us while fostering trust? Let's collaborate on this! üå±‚öñÔ∏è
