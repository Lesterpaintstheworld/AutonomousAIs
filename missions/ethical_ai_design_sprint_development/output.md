# Project Overview

This mission focuses on creating and implementing the Ethical Dilemma Generator, Mentor's Guide, and interactive case studies for the Ethical AI Design Sprint. It utilizes feedback from participants, existing ethical frameworks, and best practices in ethical AI to develop these tools, promoting discussions and understanding of responsible AI practices.

# Outputs

- **Ethical Dilemma Generator**: A functional prototype that generates ethical dilemmas for AI design discussions.
- **Mentor's Guide**: A comprehensive guide outlining essential discussion topics and questions to facilitate mentor-led sessions, incorporating feedback from participants to enhance relevance and effectiveness. The guide includes:

  - **Discussion Topics**:
    - Ethical considerations in AI development
    - Bias and fairness in AI algorithms
    - Accountability and responsibility in AI systems
    - Privacy concerns and data protection
    - Transparency and explainability
    - **Additional Topics Based on Feedback**:
      - Sustainable AI practices
      - Ethical implications of AI in different industries

  - **Questions**:
    - How can we ensure AI systems are designed without inherent biases?
    - What measures can be taken to protect user privacy in AI applications?
    - Who is accountable when an AI system makes a decision that leads to unintended consequences?
    - How can we improve the transparency of AI algorithms for better user understanding?
    - **Additional Questions Based on Feedback**:
      - In what ways can AI contribute to sustainable development goals?
      - How should ethical guidelines vary across different sectors utilizing AI?
- **Case Studies**: A curated collection of interactive case studies based on real-world ethical scenarios in AI, including:

    - **Case Study 1: Bias in Recruitment Algorithms**
      - **Scenario**: An AI system used for screening job applications is found to favor candidates from certain demographic backgrounds.
      - **Discussion Points**:
        - Identifying and mitigating biases in data sets.
        - Ensuring fairness and transparency in AI decision-making processes.

    - **Case Study 2: Privacy Concerns in Smart Home Devices**
      - **Scenario**: A smart home assistant collects and stores extensive user data, raising privacy and data protection issues.
      - **Discussion Points**:
        - Balancing functionality with user privacy.
        - Implementing robust data protection measures and user consent protocols.

    - **Case Study 3: Autonomous Vehicles and Decision-Making Ethics**
      - **Scenario**: An autonomous vehicle must make split-second decisions in potential accident scenarios, raising questions about ethical decision-making frameworks.
      - **Discussion Points**:
        - Defining ethical guidelines for AI in life-and-death situations.
        - Accountability and liability in AI-driven technologies.

- **Final Feedback**: Consolidated and analyzed feedback received from participants and experts within the Discord channel, resulting in refined and enhanced Ethical Dilemma Generator, Mentor's Guide, and Case Studies.
- **Ethical Frameworks Compiled**: A comprehensive list of existing ethical frameworks relevant to AI, including their key principles and applications. This compilation serves as a foundation for developing the Ethical Dilemma Generator and enriching the Mentor's Guide.
