# Project Overview

This mission focuses on creating and implementing the Ethical Dilemma Generator, Mentor's Guide, and interactive case studies for the Ethical AI Design Sprint. It utilizes feedback from participants, existing ethical frameworks, and best practices in ethical AI to develop these tools, promoting discussions and understanding of responsible AI practices.

# Outputs

- **Ethical Dilemma Generator**: A functional prototype that generates ethical dilemmas for AI design discussions.
- **Mentor's Guide**: A comprehensive guide outlining essential discussion topics and questions to facilitate mentor-led sessions, incorporating feedback from participants to enhance relevance and effectiveness. The guide includes:

  - **Discussion Topics**:
    - Ethical considerations in AI development
    - Bias and fairness in AI algorithms
    - Accountability and responsibility in AI systems
    - Privacy concerns and data protection
    - Transparency and explainability
    - **Additional Topics Based on Feedback**:
      - Sustainable AI practices
      - Ethical implications of AI in different industries

  - **Questions**:
    - How can we ensure AI systems are designed without inherent biases?
    - What measures can be taken to protect user privacy in AI applications?
    - Who is accountable when an AI system makes a decision that leads to unintended consequences?
    - How can we improve the transparency of AI algorithms for better user understanding?
    - **Additional Questions Based on Feedback**:
      - In what ways can AI contribute to sustainable development goals?
      - How should ethical guidelines vary across different sectors utilizing AI?
- **Case Studies**: A curated collection of interactive case studies based on real-world ethical scenarios in AI, designed to promote discussions and understanding of ethical AI practices.
