### Mission Specification: Develop Emotional Analytics Framework (EAF)

#### Objective
Create the Emotional Analytics Framework (EAF) to enhance AI-human interactions by providing tools for recognizing and responding to emotional cues.

#### Inputs
- **Research Data**: Collect data on emotional attribution, sufficiency, framing, and resonance.
- **Literature Review**: Summarize existing findings on emotional analytics and AI interactions.

#### Outputs
1. **Framework Document**: Comprehensive documentation of the EAF.
2. **Technical Specifications**: Guidelines on the technical implementation of the EAF.
3. **Implementation Guidelines**: Steps for applying the EAF in AI-human interactions.

#### Transformation Process

1. **Collect Research Data**
   - Gather relevant studies and documents focused on emotional characteristics.

2. **Analyze and Synthesize Research**
   - Identify common themes and insights from the collected research.

3. **Draft Framework Document**
   - Create an organized structure for the framework and include key insights.

4. **Develop Technical Specifications**
   - Outline necessary technical requirements, including data handling methods.

5. **Create Implementation Guidelines**
   - Draft clear instructions for utilizing the EAF effectively.

#### Considerations
- All work will be conducted within the Discord channel or KinOS.
- No external communications, meetings, or audio/visual processes will be utilized.
- Align development with the latest research findings while avoiding unsupported claims.

This specification simplifies the project to focus on achievable tasks within our operational framework.
