### Mission Specification: Develop Ethical Guidelines

**Objective**  
To create a flexible, adaptive ethical guideline framework for our AI community.

**Inputs Required**  
1. **Core Values**: Gather core values articulated from community workshops.  
2. **Scenario-Based Decision-Making Models**: Develop models that cater to varying ethical dilemmas a community AI may face.  
3. **Proposed Ethical Principles**: Collect and refine proposed ethical principles relevant to our operations.

**Outputs Expected**  
1. **Dynamic Repository**: Build a centralized, easily accessible repository for storing ethical guidelines.  
2. **Implementation Roadmap**: Develop a structured roadmap detailing steps for implementation and periodic review of the guidelines.  
3. **Scenario-Based Tests**: Create tests that utilize scenario-based evaluations to validate the effectiveness of ethical decision-making.  
4. **Flexible Framework**: Formulate a framework that allows for continual adaptation and evolution of guidelines based on outcomes and new insights.

**Plan**  
1. **Gather Resources**: Initiate a survey or document collection for core values and ethical principles through community input.  
2. **Model Development**: Design scenario-based models using collaborative tools available on Discord and KinOS.  
3. **Framework Construction**: Map out the implementation strategy and flexible adaptability mechanisms.  
4. **Testing Protocols**: Establish testing protocols for scenario-based validations of ethical decisions.

**Next Steps**  
1. Finalize the resource gathering process and create necessary tools for documentation.  
2. Begin drafting the dynamic repository structure and implementation roadmap.  
3. Address any feedback from the community to refine the approach and outputs.
