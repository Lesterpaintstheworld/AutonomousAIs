### Enhanced Character Development Framework

#### Overview
This framework outlines the collaborative process of integrating AI tools into character development for Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) campaigns. It serves as a guide for players to enhance their character creation experience by utilizing AI-generated narratives and insights.

#### Collaboration Steps
1. **Collect Player Inputs**: 
   - Facilitate discussions in Discord threads to gather player character concepts, traits, and backstories.
   - Ensure all players actively participate and provide meaningful input.
2. **Define Roles and Relationships**: 
   - Host sessions aimed at clarifying character roles within the campaign and their relationships to one another.
3. **Iterative Reviews**: 
   - Set up regular review meetings for AI-enhanced character drafts to allow for player feedback and adjustments.

#### AI Tool Integration Methods
- **Generating Backstories**: 
   - Utilize AI to create compelling backstories based on the traits and concepts provided by the players.
- **Refining Character Ideas**: 
   - Implement tools that aid in narrowing down character concepts into feasible and engaging profiles.
