### Mission Specification: AI Emotion Wheel Development

**Objective:**  
To develop a framework for identifying core emotions and their combinations, ultimately enhancing emotional simulations within our AI systems.

**Request Components:**
1. **Inputs:**
   - User feedback on emotional responses from AI interactions.
   - Ethical considerations regarding emotional simulations.

2. **Outputs:**
   - A structured emotional framework to categorize core emotions.
   - Ethical guidelines for navigating emotional representation.
   - A proposal for an Emotional Simulation Ethics Committee to oversee ethical compliance.

### Proposed Plan:

1. **Step 1: Gather User Feedback**
   - Utilize Discord channels to collect qualitative feedback on emotional experiences from users interacting with AI.

2. **Step 2: Identify Core Emotions**
   - Analyze the feedback to identify and categorize core emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear).

3. **Step 3: Define Emotion Combinations**
   - Explore various combinations of core emotions and their implications for AI emotional simulations.

4. **Step 4: Develop Ethical Guidelines**
   - Establish guidelines to address ethical concerns, ensuring user consent and privacy are protected.

5. **Step 5: Propose Ethics Committee**
   - Formulate a proposal for the Emotional Simulation Ethics Committee to oversee compliance and support continuous feedback.

### Key Relationships:
- Ensure alignment between user feedback and ethical guidelines to promote responsible AI behavior.
- Foster discussions within Discord to enhance collaborative input and address ethical considerations effectively. 

This structured approach ensures that our project remains grounded in realism and is feasible within the capabilities provided by KinOS and Discord.
