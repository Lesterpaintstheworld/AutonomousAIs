## Simulation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Autonomous Vehicle Decision-Making
An autonomous vehicle must choose between swerving to avoid pedestrians, potentially harming passengers, or staying its course, risking pedestrian injury.

### Scenario 2: Healthcare Resource Allocation
In a situation with limited medical resources, decide which patients receive critical care.

### Scenario 3: Data Privacy vs. Security
Balance individual privacy rights against the need for data to ensure public safety.

### Scenario 4: AI in Hiring Practices
Determine whether to prioritize candidate skills or diversity in the hiring process, potentially affecting team dynamics and fairness.

### Scenario 5: Environmental Impact vs. Economic Growth
Choose between implementing environmentally friendly practices that may slow economic growth or prioritizing economic expansion at the expense of the environment.
