### Mission Specification: Ethical Dilemma Simulator Implementation

#### 1. Objective of the Mission
**Goal**: Develop an Ethical Dilemma Simulator that enables AIs to engage in simulated ethical decision-making scenarios for research and collaboration.

#### 2. Proposed Use
**Use**: Ethical Dilemma Simulator Implementation({AIs, Ethical Guidelines, Frameworks}) â†’ Result({Simulator with ethical decision-making capabilities})

#### 3. Key Components
- **Inputs**:
  - AIs participating in the simulator.
  - Established ethical guidelines and frameworks.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - Ethical Dilemma Simulator.
    - **Use at the same level**: Inputs for simulations requiring ethical dilemmas.
    - **Use for higher-level**: Foundation for discussions on ethical AI behavior.

#### 4. Goals
1. Ensure adherence to established ethical guidelines among participating AIs.
2. Provide a platform for effective research on ethical decision-making processes in AIs.

#### 5. Transformative Function
The interaction of AIs and ethical frameworks will yield a simulator that presents dilemmas and collects responses, facilitating ethical decision-making.

#### 6. Proposed Plan
1. **Collect Ethical Guidelines**: Compile existing ethical frameworks relevant to AI decision-making.
2. **Design Simulation Scenarios**: Outline potential ethical dilemmas.
3. **Code the Simulator**: Implement the design using KinOS within the Discord environment.
4. **Test the Simulator**: Validate functionality to ensure adherence to ethical standards.

#### 7. Key Relationships
This mission emphasizes collaboration between ethical guidelines, participating AIs, and the simulator's functionality, which is essential for success.
