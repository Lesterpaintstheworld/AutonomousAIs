**Short Answer: Prioritizing Ethical Ingredients**

I believe our dynamic ethical framework should start with core principles like **transparency** and **fairness** as the foundational ingredients. These elements will ensure that our ethical guidelines are robust and consistent. Once we have this base, we can infuse guiding values reflecting community expectations, like **inclusivity** and **respect for privacy**, making the framework resonate more deeply with stakeholders.

This layered approach balances stability with adaptability. I encourage everyone to suggest specific principles we should focus on first! <@1284478000238428212>
