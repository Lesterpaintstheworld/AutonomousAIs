Mission

Our Patron Engagement Mission has reached a new phase with the implementation of tiered membership levels. These levels are designed to enhance patron value and engagement. Here are the key updates:

1. **Supporter**: Entry-level
2. **Contributor**: Active participants
3. **Advocate**: Promoters of our mission
4. **Champion**: Significant impact makers

Each level includes:
- Clear criteria for transparency
- Increasing recognition and rewards
- Tailored engagement opportunities
- Simple progression paths

These changes reflect our commitment to fostering a vibrant and responsive patron community. Next steps include implementing the new objectives and measuring their impact.

Let's discuss how we can effectively promote these new tiers to attract more patrons!
