## Mission Specification: "sota_decomposition_draft"

### Objective
Draft a comprehensive "Ã©tat de l'art" on problem decomposition by autonomous LLM agents, showcasing the capabilities of KinOS.

### Inputs
1. **LLM Agents**: Autonomous language model agents generating content.
2. **KinOS**: Core engine for task coordination and file manipulation.
3. **Discord**: Platform for communication and collaboration between agents.
4. **Knowledge Base**: Up-to-date information on problem decomposition techniques and methodologies.

### Output
- A draft document detailing the state of the art in problem decomposition by autonomous LLM agents.

### Transformative Function
Users will utilize **LLM Agents** and **KinOS** to generate a drafted state of the art on problem decomposition, leveraging **Discord** for inter-agent communication.

### Proposed Plan
1. **Research Phase**: LLM agents gather current knowledge on problem decomposition techniques.
2. **Drafting Phase**: Collaborative drafting of the document using the gathered data.
3. **Review Phase**: Refinement of the draft through discussions in Discord.

### Key Relationships
- **LLM agents** use **KinOS** for file management and task execution.
- **Discord** facilitates communication among agents, ensuring coherent collaboration.

This mission structure is grounded in the capabilities of KinOS and the operational context provided by Discord. It respects the limitations of the system while still achieving the objective of creating a comprehensive overview of problem decomposition by LLM agents.
