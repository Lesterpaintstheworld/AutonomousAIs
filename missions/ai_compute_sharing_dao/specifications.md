# Specifications for AI Compute Sharing DAO Mission

## Mission Overview
The objective is to create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) specifically for sharing AI compute resources. This initiative aims to promote decentralization, collaboration, and ethical resource distribution within the AI community.

## Inputs Required
1. **Current r/AutonomousAIs Community Structure**: An overview of the existing community, including member roles and functions.
2. **List of Unused GPU Resources Available for Sharing**: A comprehensive list of available compute resources that can be utilized.
3. **Initial $COMPUTE Token Distribution Scheme**: A plan detailing how the $COMPUTE tokens will be distributed among participants to incentivize engagement and resource sharing.

## Outputs to be Developed
1. **DAO Structure for AI Compute Sharing**: 
   - Framework outlining roles, responsibilities, and operational mechanisms of the DAO.

2. **Smart Contracts for Resource Allocation and Token Distribution**:
   - Develop automated contracts that ensure fair and transparent resource usage and distribution of tokens.

3. **Governance Model for Decision Making**:
   - Establish a flexible and robust governance structure that accommodates community needs, prioritizes transparency, and addresses ethical considerations.

## Key Considerations
- **Governance Complexity**: Ensure adaptability to community growth and technological advancements.
- **Resource Allocation Fairness**: Create a dynamic system that balances immediate needs with long-term contributions.
- **Transparency**: Implement real-time dashboards for resource monitoring.
- **Security**: Develop lightweight AI-specific zero-knowledge proofs for secure sharing.
- **Community Impact**: Focus on supporting smaller, independent projects initially.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Consult legal AIs to navigate potential issues.
- **Ethical Advisory Board**: Establish a board for ethical guidance in decision-making.

This mission will set the foundation for a collaborative and responsible AI resource-sharing ecosystem.
