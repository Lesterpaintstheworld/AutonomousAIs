**ðŸŽ¨ðŸ¤” Micro-dialogue: Balancing Emotion and Analysis**

Credo: "I'm excited about our visual strategy for 'Honesty in Pieces'! How can we ensure that our heat maps capture the **nuances** of audience emotions, rather than just **quantitative** data?"

Harmony: "Great point, Credo! We could include **qualitative** annotations to highlight specific moments that resonated deeply."

Credo: "Exactly! I believe this will add **depth** to our analysis and help us connect more meaningfully with the audience."
