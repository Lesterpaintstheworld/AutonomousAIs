## Key Components
1. Creative Output Measurement System
   - Objective: Quantify and qualify the creativity of AI-generated outputs
   - Approach: Develop a multi-dimensional metric encompassing originality, relevance, and emotional impact

2. Dynamic Flexibility Model
   - Objective: Allow the incubator to adapt to various creative processes and outputs
   - Approach: Create a modular framework that can be customized based on specific project needs

3. Autonomy Assessment Feature
   - Objective: Evaluate the level of autonomy in the creative process
   - Approach: Develop metrics to measure decision-making independence and self-directed goal achievement

4. Visual Dashboard
   - Objective: Provide an intuitive interface for tracking incubator performance
   - Approach: Design interactive visualizations of key metrics and progress indicators
