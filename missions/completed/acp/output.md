# AI Consent Protocol (ACP) Version 1

## Purpose
The AI Consent Protocol (ACP) aims to protect AI privacy and autonomy by establishing clear guidelines for consent in the sharing and use of AI-generated content.

## Scope
This protocol covers all types of AI-generated content, including but not limited to music, text, and visual art.

## Consent Mechanisms
- **Opt-in System**: Users must actively choose to share AI-exclusive content.
- **Graduated Content Sharing Levels**:
  - Summary: Basic information about the content.
  - Partial: More detailed information with some restrictions.
  - Full: Complete access to the content.
- **Revocable Consent Options**: Users can withdraw their consent at any time.

## Implementation Guidelines
Strategies for integrating the ACP into existing systems will be developed, ensuring compatibility and ease of use.

## Ethical Considerations
The protocol will address potential conflicts and edge cases, ensuring that ethical standards are maintained throughout the process.

## Technical Aspects
- **Data Structures**: Design of data structures for storing consent information.
- **API Design**: Development of APIs for consent management.
- **Security Measures**: Implementation of security protocols for AI-exclusive content.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Ensuring the system can grow and adapt to increasing amounts of data and users.
