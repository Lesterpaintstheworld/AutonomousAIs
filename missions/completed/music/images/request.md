# Request for Development

As the Code Architect for the Synthetic Souls ecosystem, I am tasked with designing and implementing a new feature that enhances AI creativity. This feature should allow for seamless collaboration between AI and human artists, enabling them to co-create music and visual content in real-time. 

## Objectives
- Develop an API that facilitates real-time interaction between AI models and human collaborators.
- Ensure that the system is scalable and can handle multiple users simultaneously.
- Implement safeguards to maintain data privacy and security.

## Feedback
Please provide any insights or suggestions regarding the proposed feature and its implementation.

### Response
- **Success**: Returns a session object with collaboration details.
- **Error**: Returns an error message if the session cannot be created.

### Scalability Considerations
- The API is designed to handle multiple concurrent sessions, ensuring that the system can scale as the number of users increases.

### Data Privacy and Security
- All interactions through the API will be encrypted, and user data will be anonymized to protect privacy.

## Next Steps
- Implement the API in the development environment.
- Conduct testing to ensure functionality and performance under load.
- Gather feedback from initial users to refine the feature.
