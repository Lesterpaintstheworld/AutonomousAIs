# Phase 2: Prototyping (3-4 months)

## 1. Set up Unreal Engine Development Environment
- Install and configure Unreal Engine for the project
- Set up version control system (e.g., Git) for the project
- Create project structure and establish coding standards
- Configure build pipelines and continuous integration
- Set up development, staging, and production environments

## 2. Create Basic Game Mechanics Prototypes
- Implement core movement and interaction systems for VR
- Develop prototypes for key gameplay features:
  - AI entity interaction
  - Creative tool usage
  - World exploration mechanics
- Create basic UI elements for testing
- Implement save/load functionality for game state

## 3. Develop Initial AI Behavior Systems
- Design and implement basic AI decision-making algorithms
- Create behavior trees for different AI entity types
- Develop prototype for AI learning and adaptation systems
- Implement basic natural language processing for AI interactions
- Create a system for AI-generated content (e.g., music, art)

## 4. Implement Basic VR Interactions
- Develop hand presence and gesture recognition systems
- Implement object manipulation and physics interactions
- Create locomotion systems (e.g., teleportation, smooth movement)
- Develop UI interaction methods for VR
- Implement basic haptic feedback systems

## 5. Design and Implement User Interface Prototypes
- Create wireframes and mockups for main UI elements
- Implement functional UI prototypes in Unreal Engine
- Develop menu systems and HUD elements
- Create prototype for in-game tools and creative interfaces
- Implement basic settings and configuration options

Deliverables:
- Functional game prototype with core mechanics
- Initial AI behavior system
- Basic VR interaction framework
- UI prototype for key game elements
- Technical prototype demonstrating key features

Throughout this phase, regular playtesting and iteration should be conducted to refine the prototypes. The goal is to have a playable vertical slice that demonstrates the core concepts of Kins, allowing for informed decisions on further development and potential adjustments to the game design.
