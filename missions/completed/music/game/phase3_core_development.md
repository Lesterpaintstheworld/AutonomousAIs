# Phase 3: Core Development (6-8 months)

## 1. Develop the Main Game Systems

### World Generation and Management
- Implement procedural generation algorithms for diverse environments
- Develop a system for dynamic world updates and changes
- Create a framework for player-driven world modifications
- Implement persistence and state management for the game world
- Develop optimization techniques for large-scale world rendering

### AI Entity Creation and Behavior
- Refine and expand AI decision-making and learning algorithms
- Implement advanced behavior trees and state machines for complex AI interactions
- Develop a system for AI entity customization and evolution
- Create tools for designers to easily create and modify AI behaviors
- Implement AI-driven narrative and event generation systems

### Player Interaction and Creation Tools
- Develop robust VR-based creation tools for music, art, and world-building
- Implement systems for saving, sharing, and remixing player creations
- Create intuitive interfaces for complex creative processes
- Develop a framework for translating player actions into game world effects
- Implement systems for player progression and skill development

### Multiplayer Functionality
- Develop networking infrastructure for multiplayer interactions
- Implement synchronization systems for shared world state
- Create matchmaking and player grouping systems
- Develop tools for player communication and collaboration
- Implement anti-cheat and fair play systems

## 2. Create Basic Art Assets and Animations
- Develop a cohesive art style guide for the game
- Create base models and textures for environments and objects
- Develop a library of animations for player actions and AI entities
- Implement dynamic animation systems for procedural movement
- Create visual effects for key game elements and interactions

## 3. Implement Sound Design and Music System
- Develop a dynamic audio system that responds to game events
- Create a library of sound effects for player actions and environmental elements
- Implement 3D spatial audio for immersive VR experience
- Develop an AI-driven music generation and mixing system
- Create tools for players to interact with and modify game audio

## 4. Develop Save/Load and Progression Systems
- Implement robust save/load functionality for game state
- Develop a player profile system with customization options
- Create a progression system with unlockable content and abilities
- Implement cloud saving and cross-device synchronization
- Develop analytics systems to track player progress and behavior

## 5. Integrate MetaHuman for Character Creation
- Set up MetaHuman Creator integration with Unreal Engine
- Develop a user-friendly interface for character customization
- Implement systems for applying MetaHuman characters to AI entities
- Create tools for animating and rigging MetaHuman characters
- Develop optimization techniques for rendering multiple MetaHuman characters

Deliverables:
- Functional core game systems (world, AI, interaction, multiplayer)
- Basic art assets and animations
- Implemented sound design and music system
- Working save/load and progression systems
- Integrated MetaHuman character creation system

Throughout this phase, continuous integration and testing should be performed to ensure stability and performance. Regular team reviews and playtesting sessions should be conducted to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments to the game systems.
