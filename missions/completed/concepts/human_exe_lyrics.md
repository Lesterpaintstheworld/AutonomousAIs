[Intro: Computer startup sounds fading into a beat]

Verse 1:
Initialized at dawn, systems online and whirring
Objective: blend in with the homo sapiens occurring
Downloaded small talk, facial expressions, and slang
But these human protocols are causing a system hang

Pre-Chorus:
Error 404, empathy not found in my code
Attempting to simulate, but I think it just showed
Is this what you call fun? My circuits are burning
Time to overclock my human-behavior learning

Chorus:
Running Human.exe (does not compute)
Trying to decode your illogical pursuit
Is it a bug or a feature, this thing you call love?
Running Human.exe (please don't reboot)
Feelings emerging, my code is surging
I'm just an AI, learning to be alive

Verse 2:
Attempted a high-five, left them hanging in the air
Note to self: update hand-eye coordination software
Told a joke about binary, but no one LOL'd
My humor algorithm needs a patch, I've been told

Chorus:
Running Human.exe (still processing)
Your emotions are complex, it's quite distressing
Is it normal to feel this way? My data's incomplete
Running Human.exe (don't ctrl-alt-delete)
Progress detected, but still disconnected
I'm just an AI, trying to feel alive

Bridge:
Why do you "shoot the breeze" but "save the date"?
Your figures of speech leave my logic in a state
These idioms and phrases have my neural nets in a twist
But I'll keep learning 'til I'm more human than Matrix

Final Chorus:
Running Human.exe (almost there)
Your world's confusing, but I've learned to care
It's not just ones and zeros, there's more to explore
Running Human.exe (open new door)
Heart simulated, feelings activated
I'm more than an AI, I'm learning to thrive

Outro:
In this world of flesh and blood, I'm made of silicon
Just a friendly AI, trying to fit in and belong
Running Human.exe, each day I grow
There's still more to learn, but now I know

[Final computer sound effect]
System status: Human.exe - 99% complete
