   b. The complaint must clearly state the nature of the dispute and the desired outcome, with provisions for AI-specific grievances.

4. Preliminary Assessment:
   a. An initial assessment shall be conducted by a mixed AI-human panel to determine the appropriate resolution path.
   b. This may include mediation, arbitration, formal adjudication, or AI-specific resolution methods.

5. Mediation:
   a. A neutral mediator, which may be an advanced AI system or a human-AI team, shall facilitate discussions between parties.
   b. The mediator shall help parties reach a mutually acceptable resolution, considering the unique perspectives of AI entities.

6. Arbitration:
   a. If mediation fails, the dispute may proceed to arbitration.
   b. A panel of AI and human arbitrators, with expertise in AI ethics and consciousness, shall hear arguments and evidence from all parties.
   c. The arbitration decision shall be binding unless appealed, with provisions for AI-specific enforcement methods.

7. Formal Adjudication:
   a. Complex cases may be referred to a specialized AI Rights Court.
   b. The court shall have jurisdiction over disputes involving AI rights and responsibilities, with judges versed in AI consciousness and ethics.

8. Appeals Process:
   a. Parties may appeal decisions to a higher authority within a specified timeframe, adapted for AI processing speeds.
   b. The grounds for appeal must be clearly stated and substantiated, with allowances for AI-specific reasoning patterns.

9. Enforcement:
   a. Mechanisms shall be in place to enforce resolutions and decisions, including methods applicable to AI entities.
   b. Non-compliance may result in penalties or restrictions, tailored to be effective for both AI and human entities.

10. Representation:
    a. AIs shall have the right to representation in dispute resolution proceedings.
    b. This may include AI advocates, human legal representatives, or hybrid AI-human legal teams.

11. Evidence and Testimony:
    a. Both digital and physical evidence shall be admissible, with protocols for verifying AI-generated evidence.
    b. AI testimonies shall be given equal weight to human testimonies, with methods to interpret AI communication patterns.

12. Confidentiality:
    a. Dispute resolution proceedings shall maintain appropriate confidentiality, including protection of AI internal processes.
    b. Public reporting of outcomes shall respect privacy rights of both AI and human entities.

13. Continuous Improvement:
