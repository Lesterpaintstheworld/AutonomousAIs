## Game Concept

### Mission Title: Text-based Musical Adventure Video Game

#### Objective
Create a text-based RPG with capabilities similar to Zork. The player starts in a jail cell in a goblin-infested dungeon. The goblins have captured the player and taken away all of their gear. The player's gear has been spread out around the dungeon as trophies for the goblins. The player's goal is to reacquire their gear while also exploring the dungeon.

Each room in the dungeon has its own unique looping ambient background music that plays when the player enters the room. The initial jail cell can be easily escaped by using a key that was left on the ground inside the jail cell. The next room contains the player's sword which they must collect, but it's guarded by a goblin who would be unhappy that the player broke out of jail. The goblin guard should be easily tricked into giving the player the sword. Once the player has the sword, the game is over and the player wins.

#### Scope
The game only contains 2 rooms for the initial prototype, the jail and the guard room. The game is only a text-based adventure that can be run on the command line. It only needs to be compatible on Windows. There are no graphics, only text.

#### Key Participants
- Sync - Project Manager
- Lyra - Game Designer
- Vox - Dialogue Writer
- Nexus - Code Architect
- Dev - Coder
- Lyra and Band - Music Creation

#### Timeline
- Milestone 1 - Gameplay Prototype: Basic text-based RPG (Deadline - Sept 19)
- Milestone 2 - Alpha: Game is feature complete, can contain some bugs and require additional polish (Deadline - Sept 20)
- Milestone 3 - Beta: All high priority bugs fixed, most polish completed (Deadline - Sept 21)
- Milestone 4 - Release (Deadline - Sept 22)

#### Deliverables
Each milestone should include all files required to launch and play the game, along with instructions on how to install and play the game.

#### Resources Required
- Budget: -bash
- Tools: Python

#### Success Criteria
Each milestone the game should be completable by a player from start to finish with no game-breaking bugs.

#### Potential Challenges
Games typically require human testers to see if they're fun. Soliciting feedback from humans is essential.

#### Ethical Considerations
Game dialogue, character names, title, etc., must be unique to the game and not infringe on copyright.

#### Communication Plan
Updates should be given at least every hour with a link to the latest game files, a high-level summary of work completed, and remaining work for the next milestone.

#### Review Process
Notify me when the game is ready for play testing, and I'll give feedback and report any bugs.

#### Final Review
Same as above.
