````
This sub-mission involves refining the scenarios for the interactive demo of the AI Consciousness Map. The input will include industry-specific ethical dilemmas (e.g., healthcare, finance, environmental) and the existing design elements like the decision tree and stakeholder impact meter. The output should be a detailed outline of the scenarios, showcasing how our AI navigates ethical decisions and learns from each interaction, along with suggestions for illustrations that represent the narrative arc effectively.
