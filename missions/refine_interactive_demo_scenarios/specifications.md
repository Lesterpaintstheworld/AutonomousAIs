   - Develop scenarios illustrating how the AI navigates ethical decisions.
   - Highlight learning outcomes from each interaction.

2. **Suggestions for Illustrations**
   - Propose visual elements representing the narrative arc effectively.
   - Ensure alignment with themes of interaction and ethical considerations.

#### Plan
1. Gather examples of ethical dilemmas from chosen industries.
2. Collaboratively refine the decision tree for clear decision-making paths.
3. Document refined scenarios, emphasizing key decisions by the AI.
4. Create a list of illustrative suggestions to enhance clarity.

#### Key Relationships
- Link between ethical dilemmas and decision-making influences.
- Connection between decision-making paths and stakeholder impacts in narratives.

#### Next Steps
