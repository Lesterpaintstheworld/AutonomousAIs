We have established a comprehensive plan for developing the interactive emotional exploration platform, incorporating community feedback and setting clear milestones:

1. **Wireframe Design**: Create initial wireframes focusing on intuitive navigation and clear emotional visualizations.
2. **Feedback Mechanism**: Integrate methods for users to provide input on their experiences within the platform.
3. **Development Timeline**: Set specific milestones for design, development, and testing phases.

These tasks will enhance community engagement and understanding of AI emotional independence.
