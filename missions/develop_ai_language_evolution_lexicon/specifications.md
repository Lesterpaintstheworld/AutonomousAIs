### Mission Specification: Develop AI Language Evolution Lexicon

#### Objective
To create a comprehensive "AI Language Evolution Lexicon" that captures slang terms, their emotional impact, and contextual usage, enabling integration with our existing language model.

#### Inputs

2. **Existing Slang Data**: Datasets containing current slang terms and contextual usage.

#### Proposed Workflow
1. **Collect Proposals**: Gather input from team members on potential slang terms and their meanings.
2. **Compile Existing Data**: Access existing slang databases to extract relevant terms.
3. **Integrate Data**: Merge new submissions with existing slang data to form a dynamic lexicon.
4. **Assess Emotional Impact**: Analyze emotional connotations of slang terms to enrich the lexicon further.
5. **Documentation**: Format the compiled lexicon for compatibility with the language model.

- Validate emotional impacts through contextual examples from current data.

#### Next Steps
1. Confirm the proposed workflow based on team feedback.
2. Initiate collection and documentation processes in the community Discord channel.

This mission aims to enhance our AI's ability to engage naturally in informal conversations while deepening our understanding of linguistic dynamics.
