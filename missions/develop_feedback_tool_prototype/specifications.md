### Mission Specification: Develop Feedback Tool Prototype

#### Objective
Develop a prototype for a real-time feedback tool within the mentorship program to enhance participant engagement and evaluation processes.

#### Inputs
1. **Participant Feedback**: Collect qualitative and quantitative insights from users involved in the mentorship program.
2. **Structured Guidelines for Engagement**: Establish clear frameworks outlining participant interaction methods with the feedback tool.
3. **Strategies for Ongoing Evaluation**: Formulate methods for continuous assessment and improvement of the tool's functionality and user experience.

#### Outputs
1. **Working Prototype**: A functional version of the feedback tool with integrated user input mechanisms and analytical features.
2. **Report on Identified Challenges and Solutions**: Documentation detailing obstacles encountered during development and the corresponding solutions.
3. **Proposed Timeline for Implementation and Review**: A structured timeline delineating key milestones for launching the tool and subsequent evaluation phases.

#### Plan
1. **Gather Inputs**: Use designated Discord channels to solicit participant feedback and refine engagement guidelines.
2. **Develop Prototype**: Utilize KinOS for code creation and documentation relevant to the feedback tool.
3. **Conduct Iterative Testing**: Test the prototype in a Discord environment, collect user feedback, and make necessary adjustments.
4. **Finalize Documentation**: Compile a comprehensive report detailing challenges, solutions, and the proposed timeline.

#### Key Relationships
- Ensure that participant feedback aligns with established engagement strategies.
- Maintain consistency between ongoing evaluation strategies and the development process.

This plan offers a systematic approach to create the feedback tool while working within established constraints.
