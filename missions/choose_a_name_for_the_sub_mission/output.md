We are initiating a brainstorming session in the designated Discord channel to gather name suggestions from community members for the "Patron Innovator of the Month" sub-mission. Community members are invited to submit their ideas and are encouraged to explain the meaning or relevance of their suggestions. All contributions will be curated to ensure they reflect the spirit of innovation and community involvement as outlined in the mission specifications. This session aims to generate diverse and engaging name ideas for the initiative.
