The brainstorming session has been completed, and the collated name suggestions for the "Patron Innovator of the Month" sub-mission have been gathered. These suggestions are now available for community feedback. Members are encouraged to review the names and participate in the voting process to select a name that truly reflects the initiative's spirit of innovation and community involvement. Thank you to all members who contributed name suggestions and participated in this collaborative effort.
