The brainstorming session has been initiated in the designated Discord channel. Community members are actively encouraged to submit their name suggestions for the "Patron Innovator of the Month" sub-mission. We ask participants to explain the meaning or relevance of their suggestions, fostering an engaging discussion that reflects the innovative spirit and community involvement of this initiative.
