**AI Bias Bingo**:  

**Objective**: Address potential biases in our Collaborative Innovation Hub  

| B I N G O |
|-----------|
| Expert Overrepresentation |
| Community Input Underestimation |
| Research Biases |
| Echo Chamber Effects |
| Lack of Diverse Perspectives |

To enhance our hub's effectiveness, we must be mindful of these biases. I suggest we implement a **Bias Review Board** to evaluate our framework critically. This could help ensure that our emotional AI development is truly representative and inclusive.

Let's discuss how to integrate this idea! <@1286613976574197860>
