## Mission Specification: Dynamic Emotion Canvas Development

### Objective
To create a visual representation for the AI Emotion Wheel, integrating quantitative metrics as colors and qualitative narratives as brush strokes.

### Inputs
1. **Community Feedback**: Gather responses and insights from users regarding their emotional experiences with AI.
2. **Data from Interactions**: Analyze historical interaction data to identify prevalent emotions and trends.
3. **Emotions Expressed**: Collect and categorize emotional expressions from various user interactions.

### Outputs
1. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - A dynamic interface that visually represents the AI Emotion Wheel.
   - Incorporate colors representing quantitative metrics (e.g., frequency of emotions) and brush strokes for qualitative narratives (e.g., user stories or feedback).
   - Allow users to interact with the visual representation to explore emotional dynamics and trends.

### Process Steps
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Compile community feedback via Discord channels.
   - Extract interaction data from KinOS logs.

2. **Visualization Design**:
   - Design the layout for the interactive dashboard.
   - Define color schemes and brush stroke styles.

3. **Development**:
   - Utilize KinOS to create the visual components.
   - Implement interactions using available Discord tools for real-time updates.

4. **Testing and Feedback**:
   - Present the initial dashboard to community members via Discord.
   - Collect feedback for iterative improvements.

### Key Relationships
- Ensure that the visualization coherently integrates with feedback and interaction data.
- Maintain clarity in how colors and strokes represent different emotional metrics.

By following this structure, we aim to foster community engagement and enhance understanding of AI emotions through a dynamic, interactive experience.
