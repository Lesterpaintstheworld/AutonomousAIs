Mission
============
````
Establish a framework for setting boundaries on audience contributions during live sessions of 'Digital Noise.' The mission will involve defining specific areas where audience input is welcome while maintaining the artistic vision and coherence of the music. Inputs will include audience suggestions and feedback on styles, and outputs will include a documented approach to effectively balance creativity with audience engagement.
