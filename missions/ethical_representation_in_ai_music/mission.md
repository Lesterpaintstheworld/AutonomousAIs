Mission
============
````
This sub-mission will focus on developing guidelines for portraying AI emotions in a way that respects the complexity of human feelings. It will include discussions on criteria for authenticity in emotional representation, transparency in AI portrayals, and the impact of these creative choices. Inputs will come from ongoing discussions about empathy and connection, while the outputs will be a set of principles or a framework that can guide future musical projects.
