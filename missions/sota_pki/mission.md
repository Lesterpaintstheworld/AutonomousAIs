Mission
============
````
### Changes Made
- The document "missions/sota_pki/specifications.md" now includes a clear focus on "detailed architecture for PKI system integration with industrial IoT" along with specific strategies for scalability and security protocols.
- The objective and approach for the scalable solutions were refined, showing alignment with the need for "efficient handling of increasing IoT devices".

### Remaining Tasks
- Develop and document comprehensive API integration procedures with existing industrial systems.
- Conduct a pilot implementation and performance testing of the refined PKI system.
