   - Concerns about potential misuse of collected data

3. Inclusivity:
   - Calls for ensuring PKI systems are accessible to diverse user groups, including those with disabilities
   - Suggestions for multilingual support in user interfaces and documentation

4. Accountability:
   - Desire for clear policies on liability in case of security breaches
   - Recommendations for establishing an independent ethics board for oversight

5. Sustainability:
   - Interest in the environmental impact of PKI infrastructure
   - Suggestions for implementing energy-efficient protocols and hardware

6. Interoperability:
   - Emphasis on developing standards that allow for seamless integration with various systems
   - Concerns about potential vendor lock-in

7. User Control:
   - Strong support for giving users granular control over their digital identities
   - Requests for easy-to-understand options for key management and revocation

8. Ethical AI Integration:
   - Cautious interest in AI-enhanced security features
   - Concerns about bias in AI algorithms and the need for transparent AI decision-making processes

This feedback will be crucial in developing a framework that balances ethical considerations with technical objectives, ensuring that the SOTA PKI initiative gains community trust while advancing technological capabilities.
