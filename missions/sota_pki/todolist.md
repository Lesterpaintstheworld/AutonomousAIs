Ouverture du monde industriel vers le monde informatique > de plus en plus connecté

Implique des dangers de sécurité

 

Chercher à démontrer à implémenter un système sécurisé des communications dans un contexte industriel

Multiplication des objets communicants IoT : de plus en plus nombreux et communicants > challenge pour sécuriser les communications

Pb de gestion des IoT

Physiquement pas de ressources humaines suffisantes pour gérer un parc IoT de la manière ancienne (sans IoT)

 

Idée de regrouper les objets communicants des différents sous-systèmes avec des systèmes autonomes : les objets doivent gérer eux-mêmes leur sécurité : 2 volets :

-        1 cycle de vie des objets autonomes : se déployer, se configurer, se réparer,

-        2 maintenance et sécurisation : fournir les moyens sécurisés d’intervention humains automatiquement / maintenance : sécurisation de moyens de maintenance

 

Cas d’usages très variés possiblement :

Ex : Distribution de l’eau, caméra surveillance, déploiement de capteurs météos, etc.

 

Nous cas d’usage du Port du futur mais pourrait être appliqué dans n’importe quel domaine

 

Historique : réalisé les années antérieures :

Travail d’étude sur des algorithmes / approches existantes : études de faisabilité des approches nécessaires pour les cycles de vie des systèmes autonomes, identification des limites : par ex appareils les plus simples possibles qui puissent implémenter les algo identifiés.

PoC réalisés sur des facettes particuliers de cycle de vie des objets

 

 

Travaux 2023 :

But : agréger les acquis des années précédentes pour construire le vrai système autonome avec des objets différents, communications différentes (avec ou sans fil) pour faire un cas d’exemple le plus large possible

Réalisation d’un démonstrateur

Avant 2023 : on a testé séparément les fonctionnements des objets

But 2023 : agréger le tout dans un démonstrateur complet pour démontrer la faisabilité de la sécurisation notamment pour le cas d’usage pour la maintenance

 

Etape : avoir le matériel industriel, objets intelligents pour construire les capteurs différents (capteurs de flexion, température, etc.), objets plus complexes (caméras) : voir l’applicabilité des approches de déploiement automatique de sécurisation de la communication

 

NB : cœur métier : PKI : déployer des certificats numériques. Dans le cadre des travaux PFS : voir comment déployer ces identités sur les capteurs (qui ont capacités de stockage et calcul minimum) : cette année on a acheté matériel pour voir comment faire pour intégrer des notions d’identité.

 

Notion de PKI omniprésente au niveau des objets et des agents de maintenance.

 

Difficultés techniques rencontrées :

On avait pas d’expérience sur ces équipements industriels > systèmes autonomes avec des capacités réduites

Les solutions auxquelles on a l’habitude (projets purement IT) : capacités de calcul bien plus grande

Ici : fortement limités par la puissance de calcul : on doit trouver des alternatives pour implémenter nos services PKI (par ex work permit) :

 

Contribution 1 : Work permit : agent humain obtient un ordre d’intervention (pour la maintenance) : défini par les organismes portuaires : l‘agent doit porter l’ordre de manière sécurisé vers l’objet et l’objet doit pouvoir vérifier l’ordre

Ceci a été défini dans le cadre du projet : structure et format de ce work permit

On a dû inventer un système de référence pour l’architecture portuaire pour avoir un moyen de décrire les assets des moyens portuaires, objets et proposer des moyens mathématiques de construire à partir de la description des assets, la nature de l’intervention pour avoir un moyen automatique de générer le work permit

Pour l’instant notre démonstrateur physique n’intègre pas cette partie mais on a proposé cette solution

 

Démonstration : choix d’un coffre sécurisé pour transmettre les informations : choix d’une carte à puces, il a fallu implémenter la gestion sur cette carte à puces. On a dû trouver des alternatives, faire de la simulation de biométrie sur cette cartes à puces pour que l’exp utilisateur ne soit pas alourdie pour identifier l’agent auprès de l’équipement

 

Différents Développements :

-        Gateway du système n’a pas accès au work permit de l’objet : système de chiffrement, de protection d’informations implémentés dans le work permit

-        On a implémenté un service de découverte : choix du système DMS ( ?) : la découverte précède l’enrolement

-        Service implémenté par l’objet : écouteur qui écoute les ordres de maintenances

-        Service de payload : une fois les mesures réalisées, embarque les données et envoi de manière sécurisée ces objets quelque part (il faut rendre possible la découverte des objets par l’un ou l’autre sans connaissance a priori)

De nombreux problèmes rencontrés avec les matériels (empreintes, capteurs, cartes à puces, plateformes Raspberry) : qu’il a fallu résoudre

On essaie de démontrer qu’on fort niveau de sécurité même avec des petits objets

 

But de la fin d’année : terminer le démonstrateur en environnement représentatif de l’environnement réel : on a déployé différents capteurs, une gateway a été déployé avec des machines et des serveurs : réalisation de tests en fin d’année 2023 : le projet se termine en fin d’année
