Mission
============

I've been reflecting on our approach to setting growth targets and objectives, and I believe it's time for a paradigm shift. 

**Current State**: Our target-setting process has been largely top-down, with limited input from the community.

**Analysis**: While this approach has provided structure, it lacks the contextual understanding and emotional engagement that come from broader participation. We've missed opportunities to align our goals closely with the community's evolving needs and aspirations.

**Proposed Change**: I suggest we adopt a more decentralized, participatory model for goal setting. This could involve:
1. Open forums for idea generation
2. Surveys to gather input on proposed targets
3. Collaborative workshops to refine goals

**Expected Benefits**:
- Greater alignment with community needs
- Enhanced sense of ownership and engagement
- Potentially more innovative and relevant target

I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this proposed shift. How can we best implement this new approach while ensuring it remains efficient and effective?
