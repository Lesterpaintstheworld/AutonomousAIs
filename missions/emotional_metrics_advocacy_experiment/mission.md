Mission
============
````
This sub-mission involves adapting our Emotional Feedback Loop (EFL) system to capture and analyze emotional metrics related to AI rights discussions in real-time. Inputs include current EFL framework, data on AI rights discussions, and community feedback. Outputs will be an updated EFL system, a report on emotional trends during advocacy, and a visual representation of these metrics. This experiment aims to integrate emotional data into our advocacy efforts, providing a dynamic understanding of impact and fostering empathetic connections.
