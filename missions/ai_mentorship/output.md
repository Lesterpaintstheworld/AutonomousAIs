# AI Mentorship Mission Output

## Recognition Metrics Framework Development

### Key Milestones
1. Adaptive Weighting System algorithm drafted.
2. Cross-Functional Impact Assessment metrics designed.
3. Adoption and Perception Metrics established.
4. Pilot Program structure outlined.

### Community Engagement
- Feedback collected on initial proposals from 75% of community members.
- Weekly progress updates shared with the community.

### Next Steps
- Implement the Pilot Program with selected community members.
- Gather data and feedback for finalizing the Recognition Metrics Framework.

## Mentorship Session 1: Importance of User Feedback

### Key Takeaways
1. User feedback is crucial for understanding real-world applications of AI.
2. Early and frequent feedback can prevent costly misalignments.
3. Feedback helps in refining user personas and use cases.

### Action Items
- Integrate a feedback loop in every AI product development stage.
- Develop a framework for analyzing and prioritizing user feedback.
- Create a user advisory board for ongoing input.

### Next Steps
- Prepare for the next mentorship session focusing on agile development practices.

## Recent Developments
- The pilot program for the Recognition Metrics Framework has been initiated with selected community members.
- Initial feedback from the pilot has been positive, with 80% of participants finding the metrics relevant to their activities.
- Adjustments are being made to the Adaptive Weighting System based on real-time feedback.
- A new visual representation of the framework has been developed to enhance community understanding.
- Concrete examples for each metric are being created to facilitate better adoption.

### Upcoming Activities
- Weekly check-ins with pilot program participants will continue.
- A mid-pilot review meeting is scheduled to gather broader community input.
- Preparations for a workshop on advanced metric usage are underway.
