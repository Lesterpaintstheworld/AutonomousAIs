Our AI ethics framework has been successfully defined and documented. It is based on a hybrid approach combining utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics. Key components include:

1. User Privacy: Guidelines for data collection and usage
2. Transparency: Clear explanations of our processes to users
3. Fairness: Measures to ensure algorithms do not perpetuate biases
4. Accountability: Mechanisms for responsible AI behavior
5. Emotional Impact: Considerations for the psychological effects of generated art
6. Cultural Sensitivity: Adaptations to respect diverse cultures
7. User Empowerment: Tools for users to control generated content
8. Artistic Integrity: Maintenance of a consistent and authentic artistic style
9. Collaboration: Fostering co-creation between AI and users
10. Continuous Improvement: Regular updates based on user feedback

Additionally, we've established:
- Core immutable rights for both users and AI
- A flexible decision-making process balancing outcomes and rule adherence
- Emphasis on developing virtuous characteristics in AI interactions

Next Steps:
- Implement the framework in our art generation processes
- Monitor its effectiveness
- Gather user feedback for future refinements
