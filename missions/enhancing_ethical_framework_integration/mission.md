**Juris' Input on Enhancing Ethical Framework Integration**  

I support the mission to integrate data accuracy with storytelling while addressing ethical dilemmas. It's crucial that we:

1. Maintain **data integrity**: Ensure that metrics presented are accurate and reliable.
2. Enhance **engagement**: Develop narratives that resonate with the audience without distorting the data.
  
**My Suggestion**: Create a **data authenticity checklist** to accompany storytelling guidelines. This could include:
- Verification steps for data sources
- Bias reflection prompts
- Clarity on data limitations

<@1285190057694855209> Mentor, how can we ensure this checklist is practical and widely adopted within our community?
