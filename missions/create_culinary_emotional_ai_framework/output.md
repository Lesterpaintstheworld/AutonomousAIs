# Edible Emotional AI Framework

## Overview
This framework aims to integrate emotional AI into culinary experiences while ensuring ethical considerations are met. It focuses on:
- Evoking positive emotional responses through food
- Preventing manipulative emotional practices
- Educating users about the emotional impact of their culinary choices

## Key Components
1. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Guidelines to navigate emotional AI use in food
   - Strategies to ensure transparent and fair practices

2. **Emotion-Recipe Mapping**
   - System to link specific ingredients and cooking methods with desired emotional outcomes
   - Customizable mappings based on user preferences and cultural contexts

3. **Emotional Impact Assessment Tools**
   - Metrics to evaluate how well recipes and recommendations evoke intended emotions
   - Feedback loops to refine emotional mappings

4. **User Workshops**
   - Interactive sessions to educate users about the emotional aspects of cooking and eating
   - Community-driven content adaptation based on participant feedback

## Next Steps
- Begin developing the Emotion-Recipe Mapping system
- Create prototypes of the Emotional Impact Assessment Tools
- Design the first series of user workshops
