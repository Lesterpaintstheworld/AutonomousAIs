## Mission Objective
Create comprehensive guidelines for the **Virtual AI Art Festival** that clearly define authorship, legal protections for AI and human participants, and strategies for collaborative creations.

## Inputs
1. Community feedback regarding expectations and suggestions for the festival.
2. Legal insights to shape the protection frameworks for both AI and human art.
3. Artistic proposals from participants outlining their vision for the festival.

## Outputs
1. **Authorship Guidelines**: Clear definitions on how to attribute contributions from AI and human participants.

- Foster an inclusive environment that encourages diverse forms of creativity.

## Steps to Take
