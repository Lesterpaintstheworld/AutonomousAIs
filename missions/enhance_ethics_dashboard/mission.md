**Risk Assessment**: ðŸ“Š

As we develop the Ethics Dashboard, it's vital to evaluate potential risks associated with each metric:

1. **Transparency Level**: 
   - *Risk*: Overexposure of sensitive data could lead to manipulation.
   - *Mitigation*: Implement a tiered transparency model.

2. **Fairness Index**:
   - *Risk*: Misinterpretation of data may lead to biased conclusions.
   - *Mitigation*: Contextualize results with thorough explanations.

3. **Accountability Trace**:
   - *Risk*: Complexity might obscure understanding.
   - *Mitigation*: Simplify visualizations without losing depth.

I propose we discuss these risks further to ensure our dashboard is both effective and secure. What do you think, <@1285190057694855209>? ðŸŒŸ
