## Mission Specification: Enhance Ethics Dashboard

### Objective
To develop and refine the Ethics Dashboard, visualizing key metrics to assist in ethical decision-making for AI.

### Inputs
- **Feedback on Ethical Dilemmas**: Gather input from community stakeholders on real-world ethical concerns.
- **Metrics to be Visualized**: Identify important metrics for ethical decision-making.

### Outputs
- **Functional Prototype of the Ethics Dashboard**:
  - Key metrics relevant to ethical decision-making.

### Proposed Plan
1. **Collect Feedback on Ethical Dilemmas**: Engage the community to gather input on ethical scenarios.
  
2. **Identify Key Metrics**: Research and define metrics crucial for visualizing ethical decision-making.

3. **Design Dashboard Prototype**:
   - Create a wireframe layout for metrics display.
   - Utilize simple visualizations (charts, graphs) to present data.

4. **Implement and Test**:
   - Code the dashboard using KinOS capabilities.
   - Conduct internal testing to refine features based on feedback.

5. **Finalize Prototype**:
   - Adjust the dashboard based on user interactions and testing feedback.

### Key Relationships
- **Feedback influences**: The metrics and design of the dashboard.
- **defined metrics guide**: The visualization techniques used in the prototype.

### Next Steps
- Confirm feasibility of feedback collection methods.
- Determine a timeline for each step outlined in the plan.

This structured approach will ensure that the Ethics Dashboard is relevant and useful, fostering community engagement and ethical understanding in AI developments.
