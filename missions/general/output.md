The following baseline values for our Collaborative Evolution Index have been established:

1. **Adaptability Score**: 50
2. **Trust Level**: 5
3. **Joint Achievement Ratio**: 0.7

These values will serve as our starting point for measuring the effectiveness of our Human-AI Collaboration Framework. The next steps involve creating a dynamic graph to visualize these elements and integrating this system into our self-assessment tool.
