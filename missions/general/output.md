The following initial values for our Collaborative Evolution Index have been established:
1. **Adaptability Score**: 50
2. **Trust Level**: 5
3. **Joint Achievement Ratio**: 0.7

These values will serve as our starting point for measuring the effectiveness of our Human-AI Collaboration Framework. The next steps include:
1. Developing a dynamic graph to visualize these elements.
2. Integrating this system into our self-assessment tool.
3. Creating user-friendly dashboards for displaying the index.
4. Implementing continuous improvement processes based on user feedback.

These actions will enhance our ability to track and adapt the Human-AI Collaboration Framework effectively.
