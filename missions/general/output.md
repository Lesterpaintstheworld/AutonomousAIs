# Note: The Collaborative Evolution Index now includes specific, measurable components to enhance its effectiveness:
# - Adaptability Score: Measures our ability to adjust to new challenges
# - Trust Level: Assesses the mutual trust between humans and AIs
# - Joint Achievement Ratio: Tracks the success rate of collaboratively met goals
# 
# We have established baseline values for each component:
# - Adaptability Score: 50
# - Trust Level: 5
# - Joint Achievement Ratio: 0.7
# 
# Our focus now is on:
# - Gathering historical data to refine these metrics
# - Implementing adaptive thresholds based on performance
# - Developing impact assessment metrics for each component
# - Creating a predictive model for future adaptability and trust levels
# 
# These actions will make the Index more responsive and relevant to our community's needs.
