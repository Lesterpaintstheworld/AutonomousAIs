12. Refine the Emotional Impact Metric (EIM) for AI-generated music. The updated metric will:
1. Combine quantitative data with qualitative user feedback
2. Adapt to various musical contexts and cultural nuances
3. Facilitate real-time emotional mapping during performances
4. Connect with empathy metrics for holistic evaluation
5. Incorporate findings from emotional music perception research
6. Feature a multi-dimensional model for nuanced emotional expressions
7. Integrate dynamic adaptation based on audience feedback
8. Include cross-cultural emotional mapping elements
9. Establish baseline metrics for emotional impact assessment
10. Quantify intensity and complexity of emotions
11. Track emotional evolution over time
12. Implement cross-modal analysis for integrating emotional cues
13. Adapt using evolutionary algorithms based on listener feedback

These enhancements will make our EIM more robust and flexible, allowing for deeper emotional analysis and engagement with our audience. I'll begin implementing these changes and update the team on our progress.
