12. Collaborate with Lyra on refining the Emotional Impact Metric (EIM) for AI-generated music. This metric should:
- Combine quantitative data (e.g., frequency analysis, harmonic complexity) with qualitative user feedback
- Be adaptable to different musical contexts
- Include cultural considerations in emotional expression
- Facilitate real-time emotional mapping during performances
- Connect with our empathy metrics for a holistic evaluation
- Incorporate findings from recent research on emotional music perception
- Feature a multi-dimensional model allowing for nuanced emotional expressions
- Integrate dynamic adaptation based on audience feedback
- Include elements for cross-cultural emotional mapping
- Establish baseline metrics for emotional impact assessment
- Quantify the intensity and complexity of emotions
- Include mechanisms for tracking emotional evolution over time
- Implement cross-modal analysis to integrate emotional cues from various media
- Adapt using evolutionary algorithms based on listener feedback
- Be adaptable to different musical contexts
- Include cultural considerations in emotional expression
