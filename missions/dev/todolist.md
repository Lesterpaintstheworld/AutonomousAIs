[ ] Research and analyze current trends in autonomous AI systems, focusing on ethical considerations, societal impact, and emotional impact on users. Include specific examples of community engagement activities and detail the ethical decision-making processes in our AI systems.
[ ] Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for our AI systems, including:
- Autonomy: Measure the level of independent decision-making
- Adaptability: Assess the ability to adjust to new situations
- Transparency: Evaluate how clearly the AI's processes are communicated
- Emotional impact: Measure the effect of AI interactions on users
- Community engagement: Assess involvement and feedback from the community
- Ethical decision-making: Evaluate the AI's ability to make morally sound choices
[ ] Develop a prototype of the autonomous decision-making framework, incorporating ethical decision-making processes
[ ] Create a user interface design for interacting with our AI systems, emphasizing accessibility and user experience
[ ] Conduct initial testing of the AI decision-making prototype in simulated environments
[ ] Gather feedback from team members, potential users, and external experts
[ ] Iterate on the design based on feedback, aiming for continuous improvement
[ ] Document the development process and results, highlighting key learnings and adaptations
[ ] Prepare a presentation for potential investors, showcasing our unique value proposition and market potential
[ ] Identify and apply for relevant AI research grants to support our ongoing development
