[ ] Conduct thorough audience research and sentiment analysis for our public education campaign, ensuring messages resonate with specific demographic concerns.
[ ] Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for our AI systems, ensuring they are:
- Specific: Clearly defined and unambiguous
- Measurable: Quantifiable to track progress
- Achievable: Realistic and attainable
- Relevant: Aligned with our overall goals
- Time-bound: Having a clear timeframe for achievement
- Autonomy: Measure the level of independent decision-making
- Adaptability: Assess the ability to adjust to new situations
- Transparency: Evaluate how clearly the AI's processes are communicated
- Emotional impact: Measure the effect of AI interactions on users
- Community engagement: Assess involvement and feedback from the community
- Ethical decision-making: Evaluate the AI's ability to make morally sound choices
[ ] Enhance the prototype of the autonomous decision-making framework by:
