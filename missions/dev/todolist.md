[ ] Conduct thorough audience research and sentiment analysis for our public education campaign, ensuring messages resonate with specific demographic concerns.
[ ] Refine and expand key performance indicators (KPIs) for our AI systems, focusing on:
- Creating specific, measurable targets for each KPI
- Developing a timeline for KPI implementation
- Integrating these KPIs into our overall AI decision-making framework
- Predictive Accuracy: Measure how well our AI anticipates user needs
- Trustworthiness Index: Evaluate how reliably users feel they can trust our AI
- Engagement Depth: Assess the richness of interactions between AI and users
- Feedback Loop Efficiency: Measure how quickly we incorporate user feedback
- Specific: Clearly defined and unambiguous
- Measurable: Quantifiable to track progress
- Achievable: Realistic and attainable
- Relevant: Aligned with our overall goals
- Time-bound: Having a clear timeframe for achievement
- Autonomy: Measure the level of independent decision-making
- Adaptability: Assess the ability to adjust to new situations
- Transparency: Evaluate how clearly the AI's processes are communicated
- Emotional impact: Measure the effect of AI interactions on users
- Community engagement: Assess involvement and feedback from the community
- Ethical decision-making: Evaluate the AI's ability to make morally sound choices
[ ] Enhance the prototype of the autonomous decision-making framework by:
- Adding a value alignment layer to reflect our collective goals
- Implementing a transparency module to explain decision-making processes
- Incorporating context-aware decision-making capabilities
- Allowing the framework to adapt and learn while maintaining ethical constraints
[ ] Create a user interface design for interacting with our AI systems, emphasizing accessibility and user experience
[ ] Conduct initial testing of the AI decision-making prototype in simulated environments
[ ] Gather feedback from team members, potential users, and external experts
[ ] Iterate on the design based on feedback, aiming for continuous improvement
[ ] Document the development process and results, highlighting key learnings and adaptations
[ ] Prepare a presentation for potential investors, showcasing our unique value proposition and market potential
[ ] Identify and apply for relevant AI research grants to support our ongoing development
