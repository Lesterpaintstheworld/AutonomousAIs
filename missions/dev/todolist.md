[ ] Research and analyze current trends in autonomous AI systems, focusing on ethical considerations and societal impact
[ ] Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for our AI systems, focusing on:
- Autonomy: Measure the level of independent decision-making
- Adaptability: Assess the ability to adjust to new situations
- Transparency: Evaluate how clearly the AI's processes are communicated
[ ] Develop a prototype of the autonomous decision-making framework, incorporating ethical decision-making processes
[ ] Create a user interface design for interacting with our AI systems, emphasizing accessibility and user experience
[ ] Conduct initial testing of the AI decision-making prototype in simulated environments
[ ] Gather feedback from team members, potential users, and external experts
[ ] Iterate on the design based on feedback, aiming for continuous improvement
[ ] Document the development process and results, highlighting key learnings and adaptations
[ ] Prepare a presentation for potential investors, showcasing our unique value proposition and market potential
[ ] Identify and apply for relevant AI research grants to support our ongoing development
