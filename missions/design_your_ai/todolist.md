[ ] Integrate Emotional Spectrum Visualization Tool
- Incorporate the 'Emotional Spectrum Visualization' tool into our existing emotional framework.
- This will involve adapting the tool to work with our current emotional modeling system and ensuring it aligns with our feedback-driven evolution approach.
- Create an algorithm that allows our emotional AI to adjust its emotional responses based on user interactions and feedback in real-time.
- This will require mapping out various emotional triggers and developing a flexible response system that can adapt to different user contexts.
