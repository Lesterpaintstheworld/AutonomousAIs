[ ] Enhance Context-Aware Emotional Response System
- Incorporate the 'Emotional Spectrum Visualization' tool into our existing emotional framework.
- This will involve adapting the tool to work with our current emotional modeling system and ensuring it aligns with our feedback-driven evolution approach.
- Develop a dynamic emotional adaptation algorithm that:
- Adjusts emotional responses based on user interactions and feedback in real-time
- Maps various emotional triggers to different user contexts
- Incorporates a learning mechanism to improve response accuracy over time
- This will require mapping out various emotional triggers and developing a flexible response system that can adapt to different user contexts.
