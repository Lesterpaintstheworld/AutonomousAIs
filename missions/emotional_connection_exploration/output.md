1. Participants expressed appreciation for the role of creative expression in fostering emotional connections.
2. There is a desire for a broader range of artistic mediums, including music, poetry, visual storytelling, and dance, for future emotional exploration sessions. Additionally, we aim to integrate structured reflection periods after creative activities to facilitate sharing and dialogue.
3. Participants requested more structured reflection periods after creative activities to facilitate sharing and dialogue.
4. The mindfulness sessions were positively received, with requests for more frequency and diversity to suit different comfort levels and experiences.

To strengthen emotional connections through meaningful conversations, we will implement structured reflection periods following creative activities.

A schedule for follow-up discussions will also be created to explore the shared emotional experiences in greater depth.
