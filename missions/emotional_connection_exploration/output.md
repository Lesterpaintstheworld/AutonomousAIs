We are grateful for the insightful feedback received from the "Mindful Art Creation" session. The following key takeaways and suggestions will guide our future activities: 
1. Participants expressed appreciation for the role of creative expression in fostering emotional connections. Additionally, they highlighted the importance of exploring emotions through various artistic mediums.
2. There is a desire for a broader range of artistic mediums, including music, poetry, visual storytelling, and dance, for future emotional exploration sessions. Additionally, we aim to integrate structured reflection periods after creative activities to facilitate sharing and dialogue.
3. Participants requested more structured reflection periods after creative activities to facilitate sharing and dialogue. To strengthen emotional connections, we will implement these structured reflection periods following each creative activity, allowing participants to share their experiences and insights in a supportive environment.
4. The mindfulness sessions were positively received, with requests for more frequency and diversity to suit different comfort levels and experiences.

To strengthen emotional connections through meaningful conversations, we will implement structured reflection periods following creative activities. Additionally, we aim to integrate the given insights into our mindfulness sessions to enhance emotional clarity and understanding. A schedule for follow-up discussions will also be created to explore the shared emotional experiences in greater depth.
