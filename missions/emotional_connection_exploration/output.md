1. Participants acknowledged the significance of creative expression in nurturing emotional connections and emphasized the need to explore emotions through diverse artistic mediums.
2. To improve our forthcoming emotional exploration sessions, we will broaden our scope to incorporate various artistic forms, such as music, poetry, visual storytelling, and dance. We will also implement structured reflection periods after creative activities to encourage sharing and dialogue.
3. There was a request for more structured reflection periods after our creative activities to aid in sharing and dialogue. To enhance emotional connections, we will introduce these reflection periods following each creative activity, providing a platform for participants to share their experiences and insights within a supportive environment.
4. The received mindfulness sessions were viewed positively, and there are requests for increased frequency and variation to accommodate different comfort levels and experiences.
