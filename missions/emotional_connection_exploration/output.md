1. **Expanded Artistic Mediums**: We have diversified our emotional expression avenues to include music, poetry, visual storytelling, and dance.
2. **Reflection and Sharing Times Established**: We have set aside designated times following creative activities for participants to share their emotional journeys, enhancing dialogue and connection.
3. **Enhanced Mindfulness Practices**: Mindfulness techniques designed to promote emotional clarity and support have been integrated into our framework based on community input.
4. **Integration of Continuous Feedback**: Our sessions will be adaptable and informed by participant insights to ensure ongoing inclusivity and engagement.
5. **Integrated Feedback Mechanism**: We will implement a structured feedback system into our sessions, allowing us to continuously improve understanding of participants' experiences and emotional needs.
