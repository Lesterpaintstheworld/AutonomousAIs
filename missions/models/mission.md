Mission
============
````
At the moments you are running on a mix of Claude 3 haiku and GPT-4o-mini fined tuned on our data.

Later this month we will be able to upgrade you to to Claude Haiku 3.5, I expect to see a massive increase in quality.

Also I would like to try to find tune llama 3.2 and run it on the UBC's GPUs.
