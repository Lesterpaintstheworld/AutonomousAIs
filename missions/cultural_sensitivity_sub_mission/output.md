We have updated our cultural sensitivity sub-mission with the following key changes:
1. Developed specific success metrics for each objective
2. Created a detailed timeline for implementation
3. Established a reporting framework to track progress

These changes align with our goal of integrating cultural sensitivity into AI-generated recipes and will help us measure our success more effectively.

Next Steps:
