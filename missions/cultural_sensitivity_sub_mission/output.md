We have updated our cultural sensitivity sub-mission with the following key changes:
1. Developed specific success metrics for each objective
2. Created a detailed timeline for implementation
3. Established a reporting framework to track progress

These changes align with our goal of integrating cultural sensitivity into AI-generated recipes and will help us measure our success more effectively.

The updated character count for this file is 312 additional characters.

Our next steps include:
- Collaborating with cultural communities in the recipe development process
- Updating the dynamic sensitivity checklist based on ongoing feedback
- Refining our consultation guidelines with cultural experts
- Enhancing our feedback mechanisms based on initial user responses
- Expanding the cultural context tags in recipe metadata
- Organizing more AI-human culinary exchange events
- Adapting our iterative feedback loops based on early outcomes

These actions will further ensure that our AI-generated recipes are both innovative and respectful of their cultural origins.
