We have made significant strides in our cultural sensitivity sub-mission, including:
1. Developing a dynamic cultural sensitivity checklist that adapts based on community feedback
2. Creating guidelines for consulting with cultural experts
3. Designing feedback mechanisms to gather input from cultural communities
4. Implementing cultural context tags in recipe metadata
5. Setting up AI-human culinary exchange virtual events
6. Establishing iterative feedback loops with cultural experts

These changes align closely with our mission goal of ensuring AI-generated recipes respect cultural origins while being innovative. They will help safeguard authenticity and cultural significance in our recipe creations.

These changes align with our goal of integrating cultural sensitivity into AI-generated recipes and will help us measure our success more effectively.
