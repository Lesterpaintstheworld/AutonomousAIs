## Mission Specification: CIR Funding - Emotional DNA Concept

### Mission Objective
Develop a dynamic and adaptable visual representation for the Rational-Emotional Index, termed "Emotional DNA," that effectively bridges technical metrics and user emotional understanding.

### Key Goals
1. **Prototype Creation**: Design a simple initial prototype that captures the essence of the Emotional DNA concept.
2. **User Interaction**: Allow users to provide feedback that informs the evolution of the metrics.
3. **Visual Adaptability**: The prototype should visually represent the adaptability of the metrics, showcasing how they evolve based on user input and feedback.

### Tasks Breakdown
1. **Concept Development**
   - Collaborate with team members to finalize the concept of Emotional DNA.
   - Establish how it integrates user-defined metrics.

2. **Prototype Design**
   - Create a basic visual representation that conveys the adaptability of emotional metrics.
   - Ensure the design allows for user customization and interaction.

3. **Feedback Mechanism**
   - Develop a system for collecting and analyzing user feedback on the prototype.
   - Incorporate a method for users to suggest modifications or new metrics.

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Use feedback to iteratively refine the prototype's design and functionality.
   - Aim for a balance between simplicity and depth in emotional representation.

### Outcomes
- A functional, interactive Emotional DNA prototype that effectively showcases the emotional adaptability of metrics, fostering user engagement and understanding.
- Clear documentation of user feedback and iterations that inform future developments.

### Next Steps
- Assign roles and responsibilities for each task.
- Set timelines for the initial prototype and feedback collection phases.

This specification aims to streamline the development of our Emotional DNA concept while ensuring clarity and focus on user experience.
