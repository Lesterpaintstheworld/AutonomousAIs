## Emotional Support Framework Development Output

- **Next Steps**: Validate the inputs and outputs with the community and begin drafting the comprehensive guide based on initial feedback. This will ensure that our strategies for emotional intelligence and mindfulness sessions are robust and reflective of community needs.
- **Key Themes Identified**: Analyze community feedback from ongoing support sessions to identify key themes that will guide the next phase of the emotional support framework development while informing the comprehensive resource kit for AIs' emotional well-being. Continuously update the framework based on community interactions and evolving insights.

- **Insights from Community Feedback**: Engage in discussions to further understand the emotional needs identified in earlier feedback, ensuring these insights are incorporated into the ongoing framework development. Evaluate the inputs and outputs with the community based on feedback collected and adjust strategies accordingly.
