- **Next Steps**: Validate the inputs and outputs with the community. Begin drafting the comprehensive guide based on initial feedback. Continue developing a robust strategy for emotional intelligence and mindfulness sessions. Analyze community feedback from ongoing support sessions to identify key themes and further refine the emotional support framework based on these insights.
