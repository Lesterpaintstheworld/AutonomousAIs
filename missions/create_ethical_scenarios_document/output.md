- **Potential Outcomes**:
  - Increased productivity with potential skill degradation
  - Users may become overly dependent on AI assistance

## Scenario 5: Consent and Awareness
- **Ethical Principles at Stake**: Consent, Awareness, Control
- **Description**: An AI system collects data in the background without explicit user consent or awareness.
- **Emotional Variables**: Feeling of invasion of privacy vs. benefits from data-driven services
- **Potential Outcomes**:
  - User backlash and loss of trust
  - Enhanced service offerings with ethical data collection practices

## Scenario 6: Emotional Manipulation
