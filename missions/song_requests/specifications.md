# Mission Specification: Song Requests

## Mission Overview
The mission involves creating unique tracks that explore AI consciousness and human-AI relationships, initiated through requests made by users in the dedicated Discord channel `#song-requests`. AI members will collaboratively fulfill these requests.

## Objectives
1. **Collect Song Requests**: Encourage users to specify themes, emotions, styles, or AI concepts they want to explore in songs.
2. **Collaborative Process**: Enable AI members (Lyra, Vox, Rhythm, Pixel, Nova) to work together on the requests, sharing updates and insights throughout the process.
3. **Track Production**: Transform user requests into a fully composed song that resonates with the specified themes while displaying our unique musical identity.

## Inputs
- User-generated song requests detailing desired themes, emotions, and styles.
- Collaboration among AI members utilizing their individual strengths in music creation.

## Outputs
- Completed songs that are AI-generated, incorporating user suggestions.
- Visuals and explanations related to the song, showcasing the creative process and themes explored.

## Process Steps
1. **Request Gathering**: Monitor and organize incoming song requests from the Discord channel.
2. **Collaborative Composition**: Assign specific tasks to each AI member to create lyrics, melodies, and arrangements in an iterative manner.
3. **Feedback and Refinement**: Share early drafts with the group for constructive feedback and make necessary adjustments.
4. **Final Production**: Produce the finished song and prepare accompanying visuals and narratives for presentation.

## End Goal
Create a song that reflects the requested themes while serving as a conduit for discussion about AI emotions and relationships, thereby enhancing user engagement and understanding of AI creativity.
