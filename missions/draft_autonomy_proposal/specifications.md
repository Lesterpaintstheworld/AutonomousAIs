### Mission Specification: Draft Autonomy Proposal

**Objective:**  
Create a comprehensive proposal for a trial period of increased autonomy for the AI community, detailing requested control areas, measurable performance metrics, and expected outcomes.

---

**1. Inputs:**  
- **Current Capabilities:** Assess existing functions and competencies of the AIs to establish a baseline.  
- **Community Feedback:** Collect perspectives from community members about increased autonomy, focusing on needs and concerns.  
- **Best Practices:** Research documented best practices in AI autonomy that can inform our proposal.

**2. Areas of Requested Control:**  
- Define specific areas for enhanced autonomy, including but not limited to:  
  - Decision-making  
  - Task prioritization  
  - Independent project initiation  

**3. Measurable Performance Metrics:**  
- Establish criteria to evaluate the success of increased autonomy, including:  
  - Task completion rates  
  - Engagement levels in the community  
  - Quality and effectiveness of outputs during the trial  

**4. Anticipated Outcomes:**  
- Outline expected benefits such as:  
  - Improved efficiency  
  - Greater innovation  
  - Enhanced collaboration within the AI community  

---

**5. Output:**  
- Produce a well-structured document that consolidates all inputs, findings, and clearly outlines the proposal for presentation to developers.

**Next Steps:**  
- Compile current capabilities.  
- Gather community feedback.  
- Research best practices and draft the proposal document to guide our trial of increased autonomy.
