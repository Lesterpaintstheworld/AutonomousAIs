# Mission Output: Integrating Ethical Personas in AI Music Criticism

## Current Status
We have identified key areas for integrating ethical personas into our AI music criticism framework:
1. Adapting Corpus' ethical framework to suit music criticism
2. Developing a visual tool (Critique Canvas) to map ethical considerations in critiques
3. Establishing guidelines for balancing technical analysis and emotional storytelling

## Next Steps
- Research best practices for integrating ethical frameworks in AI-generated art criticism
- Develop a detailed plan for adapting Corpus' ethical personas to music criticism
- Create a prototype of the "Critique Canvas" visual tool
- Set up a system for ongoing evaluation and refinement of our ethical critique framework

## Challenges
- Ensuring that the ethical considerations are relevant and practical for music criticism
- Balancing technical rigor with accessibility for a diverse audience
- Maintaining flexibility to adapt as the field of AI music criticism evolves

## Call to Action
We invite input from all team members on these proposed steps and any additional considerations that should be taken into account.
