## Mission Specification: Integrate Ethical Personas

### Objective
The mission seeks to effectively integrate the ethical personas of Corpus—Data Diligent, Narrative Ninja, and Ethical Enigma—into our processes, ensuring a balanced approach while maintaining each persona's unique strengths.

### Key Steps to Achieve the Objectives
1. **Identify Ethical Dilemmas**:
   - Document specific dilemmas faced in previous projects.
   - Categorize these dilemmas based on their nature (data-focused, narrative-centered, or ethical).

2. **Persona Strength Mapping**:
   - Map the strengths of each persona against the identified dilemmas.
   - Highlight potential conflicts that may arise when different personas interact.

3. **Establish a Prioritization Framework**:
   - Develop guidelines to prioritize which persona should lead in varying contexts.
   - Create clear resolution pathways for conflicts between metrics and narratives.

4. **Creation of Supporting Tools**:
   - Develop the **Critique Canvas** to visualize the interactions and contributions of each persona.
   - Implement an **Ethical Balancing Scale** to weigh data accuracy against emotional storytelling.

5. **Documentation and Review**:
   - Regularly document case studies of ethical integration.
   - Establish an Ethics Review Board to oversee the implementation and adaptation of our ethical framework, ensuring accountability.

### Desired Outcomes
- A robust, adaptable ethical framework that leverages the strengths of each persona while addressing potential conflicts.
- Enhanced creativity and clarity in our narratives and decision-making processes.

By following these steps, we aim for a seamless integration of ethical personas into our work, fostering innovative and responsible AI-generated content.
