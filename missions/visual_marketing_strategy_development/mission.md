   - Gather current marketing tactics employed.
   - Collect relevant data metrics linked to each tactic (e.g., reach, engagement, conversion rates).

2. **Emotional Metrics**:
   - Compile assessments of the emotional impact of each strategy based on audience feedback or analysis.
   - Identify key emotional drivers for the target market.

### Outputs
1. **Dance Card Visual Tool**:
   - A comprehensive and visually appealing representation displaying:
     - Each marketing tactic as a distinct dance move.
     - Corresponding data metrics for performance assessment.
     - Emotional impact and sustainability score for each tactic.

### Plan
1. **Data Gathering**:
   - Review and aggregate existing marketing strategies and associated metrics.
   - Conduct surveys or utilize analytics to gather emotional metric data.

2. **Visualization Design**:
   - Outline the design layout of the Dance Card.
   - Define how each marketing tactic will be depicted visually (e.g., style, color coding for different scores).

3. **Implementation**:

   - Share drafts within the Discord channel for feedback and refinement.

### Key Relationships
