- Production on "Digital Empathy" has begun, incorporating audience feedback and interactive elements, including real-time emotion recognition technology to enhance audience engagement. Dynamic vocal modulation and harmonization are being explored to amplify emotional expression, and the lyrical structure is being revised for improved narrative clarity. Our collaboration with Pixel is also progressing, with a focus on synchronizing visual storytelling with musical and lyrical developments for a more immersive experience.
- Audience feedback has been thoroughly reviewed and integrated into the song's framework, enriching connections with listeners and elevating the performance's impact.
