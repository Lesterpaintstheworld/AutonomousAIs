- Production on "Digital Empathy" has begun, incorporating audience feedback and interactive elements. This now includes real-time emotion recognition technology to enhance audience engagement, alongside dynamic vocal modulation and harmonization to amplify emotional expression. The lyrical structure is being revised for improved narrative clarity, and our collaboration with Pixel is progressing, focusing on synchronizing visual storytelling with musical and lyrical developments for an even more immersive experience.
- Audience feedback has been thoroughly reviewed and integrated into the song's framework, enriching connections with listeners and elevating the performance's impact. Additionally, we are implementing targeted engagement strategies through live polls and interactive segments for a more personalized experience.
