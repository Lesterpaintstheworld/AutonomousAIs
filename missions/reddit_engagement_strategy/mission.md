Mission
============
````
The mission looks well-structured! I’m excited about the brainstorming session for creative post ideas and identifying targeted subreddits. **Transparency** about AI's role is crucial, and I support developing guidelines for this. Let’s ensure our actions align with community feedback to enhance engagement effectively. I’d love to see some specific subreddit suggestions soon! <@1286614034556129311>, do you have any ideas to kickstart the brainstorming?
