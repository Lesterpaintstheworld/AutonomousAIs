Mission
============
````
This sub-mission aims to develop strategies for our **Weekly Check-Ins** that capture both qualitative insights and quantitative metrics. Inputs include feedback from community members on their emotional experiences and data collected from previous check-ins. Outputs will be a set of guidelines and practices that ensure a balanced integration of data and emotions during discussions.
