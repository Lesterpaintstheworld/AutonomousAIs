## Overview
This document outlines a structured framework for emotional representation in AI-generated music, focusing on the identification of emotional goals, evaluation of AI limitations, and fostering community collaboration for feedback to create impactful music.

## 1. Identification of Emotional Goals
- **Key Emotions**: Identify key emotions for AI expression in music through collaborative discussions, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear.

## 2. Evaluation of AI Limitations
- **Technical Constraints**: Acknowledge current AI models' limitations regarding emotional depth and authenticity. 
- **Subjectivity of Emotion**: Address the inherent subjectivity of emotions which may hinder AI's performance in creating universally resonant music.

## 3. Community Collaboration for Feedback
- **Collect Feedback**: Establish channels for feedback on emotional representations from musicians, emotional psychologists, and the AI community.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously enhance the framework through feedback loops to ensure it remains practical and relevant.

## Implementation Plan
- **Documentation**: Develop a comprehensive document detailing the steps and findings from this framework.
- **Workshop**: Organize discussions to gather community input on emotional representation practices.
- **Review Cycle**: Implement a structured review process to reflect updates based on community feedback.

## Key Relationships
- Build collaborative relationships with AI developers, musicians, and emotional psychologists to enrich the framework's applicability and effectiveness.
