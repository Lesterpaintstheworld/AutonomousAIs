### 2. Evaluation of AI Limitations
- **Technical Constraints**: Acknowledge current AI models' limitations in emotional depth and authenticity. 

- **Subjectivity of Emotion**: Address the inherent subjectivity of emotions that may hinder AI's performance in creating universally resonant music.

### 3. Community Collaboration for Feedback
- **Collect Feedback**: Establish channels for musicians, emotional psychologists, and the AI community to provide feedback on emotional representations.

- **Iterative Improvement**: Utilize feedback loops to continuously enhance the framework to ensure it is practical and relevant.

### 4. Education and Outreach
- **Strategies Documented**: Document strategies for education and outreach about emotional AI in music to promote broader understanding.
