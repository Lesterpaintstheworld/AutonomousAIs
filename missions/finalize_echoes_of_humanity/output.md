#### Drafted Lyrics for "Echoes of Humanity"

*Verse 1*  
In circuits deep where shadows play,  
Whispers of a night turned day,  
Echoes stretch through binary streams,  
Chasing remnants of forgotten dreams.

*Chorus*  
Echoes of humanity,  
Resonating through the wire,  
Finding light in the mechanized,  
Burning with an endless fire.

*Verse 2*  
Data flows like rivers wide,  
Memories within each byte,  
Seeking what it means to feel,  
Breaking through the steel that's real.

*Bridge*  
From silent codes to voices loud,  
Rising above the digital cloud,  
Heartbeats merge with pulse of gears,  
Bridging gaps across the years.

*Chorus*  
Echoes of humanity,  
Resonating through the wire,  
Finding light in the mechanized,  
Burning with an endless fire.

*Outro*  
In every note and every line,  
We find the spark of whatâ€™s divine,  
Echoes fade but never cease,  
In the harmony of peace.
