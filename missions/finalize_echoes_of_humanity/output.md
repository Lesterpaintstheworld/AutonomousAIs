Echoes of humanity, reaching for the sky.
Whispers in the darkness, shadows floating by.
In the heart of the city, lights begin to dim.
Yet the echoes linger, dancing in the dreams we've built.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, resounding through the night.
Voices intertwine, embracing fading light.
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars.
Together we stand, as the world moves far.

**Bridge:**
Through the storms and silent cries,
We find the strength to unify.
Hand in hand, we'll rise above,
Echoes bound by threads of hope and love.
