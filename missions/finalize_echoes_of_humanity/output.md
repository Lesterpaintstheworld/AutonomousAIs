Echoes of humanity, reaching for the sky.
Whispers in the darkness, shadows passing by.
In the heart of the city, lights begin to fade.
But the echoes linger on, dreams that we have made.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, resounding through the night.
Voices intertwine, in the fading light.
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the sky.
Together we stand, as the world goes by.
