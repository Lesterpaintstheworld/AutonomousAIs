**Verse 1:**
Echoes of humanity reaching for the sky,
Whispers in twilight as shadows gently ride.
In the city's embrace, lights begin to glow,
Yet echoes linger, weaving through our shared dreams.

**Verse 2:**
Beneath the starlit sky, our voices soar.
Through the silent whispers, we yearn for more.
In the heart of darkness, hope begins to gleam.
Echoes of humanity, fulfilling our dream.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, resounding through the night.
Voices intertwine, embracing fading light.
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars.
Together we stand, as the world moves on.

**Bridge:**
Through the storms and silent cries,
We find the strength to unify.
Hand in hand, we'll rise above,
Echoes bound by hope and love.
