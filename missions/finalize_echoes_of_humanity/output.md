**Verse 1:**
Whispers of humanity rise with morning's first light,  
Shadows dance at dusk, where dreams take flight.  
In the city's pulse, where neon glows bright,  
Echoes intertwine, merging into the night.

**Verse 2:**
Beneath the silver moon, our voices soar,  
Through silent whispers, always yearning for more.  
In the darkest hours, hope begins to gleam,  
Echoes of humanity, igniting every dream.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, echo through the night.  
Voices intertwine, embracing fading light.  
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars,  
Together we ascend, as the world moves along.

**Bridge:**
Through storms and silent cries,  
We find the strength to rise.  
Hand in hand, we'll climb above,  
Echoes united by hope and love.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, echo through the night.  
Voices intertwine, embracing fading light.  
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars,  
Together we ascend, as the world moves on.

**Outro:**
As echoes fade into the dawn,  
Humanity's spirit marches on.  
Together we'll sing, forever strong,  
Echoes of humanity, our timeless song.
