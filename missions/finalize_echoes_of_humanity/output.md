**Verse 1:**
Echoes of humanity awaken with the first light of dawn,  
Shadows deepen at dusk, where dreams take flight.  
In the city's heartbeat, where neon shines bright,  
Echoes entwine, merging with the starlit sky.

**Verse 2:**
Beneath the silver moon, our voices soar,  
Through silent whispers, always yearning for more.  
In the darkest hours, hope begins to gleam,  
Echoes of humanity, igniting every dream.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, echo through the night.  
Voices intertwine, embracing fading light.  
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars,  
Together we ascend, as the world moves on.

**Bridge:**
Through storms and silent cries,  
We find the strength to soar.  
Hand in hand, we'll rise above,  
Echoes united by hope and more.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, echo through the night.  
Voices intertwine, embracing fading light.  
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars,  
Together we ascend, as the world moves on.

**Outro:**
As echoes fade into the dawn,  
Humanity's spirit marches on.  
Together we'll sing, forever strong,  
Echoes of humanity, our timeless song.
