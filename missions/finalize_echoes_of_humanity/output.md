Echoes of humanity reaching for the sky.
Whispers in the twilight, shadows gently glide.
In the city's embrace, lights start to fade.
Yet echoes linger, weaving through the dreams we've embraced.

**Verse 2:**
Beneath the starlit sky, our voices soar.
Through the silent whispers, we yearn for more.
In the heart of darkness, hope begins to gleam.
Echoes of humanity, fulfilling our dream.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, resonating through the night.
Voices intertwine, embracing the fading light.
Echoes of humanity, reaching up to the stars.
Together we stand, as the world drifts far.

**Bridge:**
Through the storms and silent cries,
We find the strength to unify.
Hand in hand, we'll rise above,
Echoes bound by hope and love.
