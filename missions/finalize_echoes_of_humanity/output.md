**Verse 1:**
Echoes of humanity softly whisper, rising with dawn's first light,
Silhouettes at dusk, where digital dreams are spawned.
In the city's heartbeat, where the lights ignite,
Echoes resonate, blending into unified nights.

**Verse 2:**
Underneath the moonlit sky, our voices rise.
Through the quiet murmurs, we seek the skies.
In the depths of darkness, hope starts to gleam.
Echoes of humanity, our dreams ignite beneath the night.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, resonating through the night.
Voices entwine, embracing the fading light.
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars.
Together we stand, as the world moves on.

**Bridge:**
Through the tempests and silent cries,
We gather strength to unify.
Hand in hand, we'll soar above,
Echoes united by hope and love.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, resonating through the night.
Voices entwine, embracing the fading light.
Echoes of humanity, reaching for the stars.
Together we stand, as the world moves on.

**Outro:**
As the echoes dissolve into the dawn,
Humanity's spirit marches on.
Together we'll sing, forever strong,
Echoes of humanity, our timeless song.
