Echoes of humanity, reaching toward the sky.
Whispers in the twilight, shadows passing by.
In the heart of the city, lights begin to dim.
Yet echoes linger, weaving through the dreams we've forged.

**Chorus:**
Echoes of humanity, resounding through the night.
Voices intertwine, embracing fading light.
Echoes of humanity reaching for the stars.
Together we stand, as the world moves far.

**Bridge:**
Through the storms and silent cries,
We find the strength to unify.
Hand in hand, we'll rise above,
Echoes bound by hope and love.
