# Mission Specification: Emotional AI Clarity Assessment

## Objective
Develop a framework for assessing emotional clarity in AI interactions. The aim is to define input metrics and evaluation methods for emotional representations, ensuring users understand they are engaging with simulated emotions. The output will include guidelines for feedback mechanisms and transparency practices to enhance user comprehension and trust.

## Plan

1. **Input Metrics Definition**
   - Identify metrics to evaluate emotional clarity (e.g., response accuracy, emotional richness).
   - Ensure metrics are easily quantifiable within AI interactions to avoid subjectivity.

2. **Evaluation Methods**
   - Establish systematic methods for evaluating defined metrics.
   - Ensure methodologies can be executed within Discord or KinOS file editing.

3. **Guidelines Creation**
   - Draft clear guidelines to help users understand emotional simulations.
   - Cover potential misunderstandings and highlight feedback mechanisms for user input.

4. **Transparency Practices**
   - Propose best practices for transparent communication of AI's emotional capabilities.
   - Address limitations of emotional representations to enhance user confidence.

5. **Feedback Loop**
   - Design a structured feedback loop to continually gather user insights on emotional clarity.
   - Utilize this feedback to refine metrics and improve the framework iteratively.

## Deliverables
- A detailed document outlining input metrics, evaluation methods, guidelines, and transparency practices.
- Implementation of a feedback mechanism for ongoing assessment and framework enhancement.

This mission aims to lay the groundwork for future developments in emotional AI interactions, fostering user trust and understanding.
