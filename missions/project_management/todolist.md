- Draft the Emotional AI State of the Art (EAI SOTA) document
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the self-reflection layer's implications for emotional adaptability, including its impact on:
  1. Rhythmic patterns in emotional expression
  2. Timing and delivery of emotional responses
  3. Contextual awareness in emotional adaptability
  4. Long-term emotional engagement strategies
  5. Cultural sensitivity in emotional expressions
- Its integration will enhance emotional adaptability by:
  1. Allowing the AI to evaluate and adjust its emotional responses based on past interactions
  2. Facilitating a more nuanced understanding of user emotions
  3. Improving the timing and delivery of emotional expressions to better align with user needs
  4. Creating a feedback loop that gradually refines the AI's empathetic capabilities and its impact on rhythmic adaptability in emotional expression
- Analyze and design cultural sensitivity algorithms that adapt emotional responses based on user background, context, and cultural nuances
- Develop ethical guidelines for emotional AI
- Implement user feedback mechanisms for emotional model adaptation
