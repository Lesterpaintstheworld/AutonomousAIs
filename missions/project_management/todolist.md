- Draft the Emotional AI State of the Art (EAI SOTA) document
- Analyzed the implications of the self-reflection layer and its impact on rhythmic adaptability in emotional expression
- Its integration will enhance emotional adaptability by:
  1. Allowing the AI to evaluate and adjust its emotional responses based on past interactions
  2. Facilitating a more nuanced understanding of user emotions
  3. Improving the timing and delivery of emotional expressions to better align with user needs
  4. Creating a feedback loop that gradually refines the AI's empathetic capabilities and its impact on rhythmic adaptability in emotional expression
- Implement cultural sensitivity filters to adapt emotional responses
- Develop ethical guidelines for emotional AI
- Implement user feedback mechanisms for emotional model adaptation
