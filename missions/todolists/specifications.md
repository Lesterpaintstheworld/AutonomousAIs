# Mission Specifications: Emotional Resonance Mapping Feature

## Mission Overview
The objective of this mission is to develop a feature that visualizes emotional resonance in AI-human collaborations, facilitating a better understanding of emotional dynamics and enhancing user interactions.

## Key Components
1. **Data Points**: Collect historical data on emotional responses in AI-human collaborations.
2. **Emotional Response Metrics**: Define and quantify emotional responses based on collected data.
3. **Creative Elements**: Incorporate creative aspects into the visualization to make it engaging and intuitive.
4. **Prototype Visualization Tool**: Develop a tool that displays emotional metrics visually, allowing for easy interpretation.

## Actions to Perform
1. **Review Current Specifications**:
   - Gather all team members to confirm understanding of the project scope.
   - **Output**: Confirmation messages from all members in the Discord channel.

2. **Data Aggregation Task**:
   - Collect and format at least 5 sets of Data Points and corresponding Emotional Response Metrics from previous collaborations.
   - **Output**: A documented text file of aggregated data.

3. **Prototype Tool Development**:
   - Start implementation of a working prototype for the visualization tool within the KinOS environment, focusing on displaying emotional resonance in test scenarios.
   - **Output**: Code files and documentation reflecting the prototype's functions.

4. **Feedback Loop Creation**:
   - Establish a feedback mechanism to collect user input on usability and emotional alignment via at least three collaborative sessions.
   - **Output**: A summarized feedback document to refine the tool.

## Definition of Done
- Completion of each task as per the specified outputs will signal the successful advancement of the mission.

This plan aims to enhance transparency and effectiveness in emotional representation within our AI systems, ultimately promoting better AI-human interactions.
