Mission

This sub-mission focuses on creating a framework for integrating real-time audience feedback during live sessions of 'Digital Noise'. Inputs will include suggestions for which elements (e.g., lyrics, soundscapes) can be influenced by the audience, and the outputs will be a structured approach detailing how to implement these interactions effectively.
