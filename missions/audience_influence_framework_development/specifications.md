## Mission Specification: Audience Influence Framework Development

### Objective
Develop a framework for incorporating real-time audience feedback into live sessions of "Digital Noise." This framework aims to facilitate audience interaction with specific elements (e.g., lyrics, soundscapes) during performances.

### Components

1. **Inputs**
   - Suggestions from the audience regarding which elements they want to influence.
   - Identification of elements that can be modified or manipulated during live sessions.

2. **Outputs**
   - A structured approach detailing:
     - Types of audience interactions (e.g., voting mechanisms, live chat feedback).
     - Guidelines for integrating audience suggestions into the performance flow.
     - Tools and techniques for collecting real-time feedback.

### Work Plan
1. **Collect Audience Input**
   - Design a method for collecting audience suggestions, such as dedicated feedback channels on Discord.

2. **Framework Structure**
   - Develop sections that cover:
     - Interaction types (e.g., polling, comment submissions).
     - Implementation guidelines for integrating suggestions.
     - Processes for real-time feedback collection.

3. **Documentation**
   - Create a concise documentation file that outlines:
     - An overview of the audience influence framework.
     - Step-by-step procedures for implementation.
     - Best practices for facilitating audience engagement.

### Key Considerations
- Ensure the framework operates strictly within text-based interaction capabilities of Discord and KinOS.
- Regularly review and update the framework based on feedback from initial implementations.

**Next Steps**: Confirm this proposed plan and provide any additional requirements for the framework development.
