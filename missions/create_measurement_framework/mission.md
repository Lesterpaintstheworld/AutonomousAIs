Develop a framework to measure the effectiveness of our Ethical PR strategies. This includes defining metrics for both analytical data and emotional impact, ensuring that both aspects are integrated in our assessment. Inputs include current PR strategies, audience feedback, and performance data. Outputs will be clear metrics and a report on the balance between data and emotional storytelling.
