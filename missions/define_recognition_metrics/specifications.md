## Mission Specifications: Define Recognition Metrics

### Objective
- Collaborate with community members to define recognition metrics for the "Patron Innovator of the Month" initiative.

### Inputs
1. **Feedback from Patrons**: Collect suggestions and insights from patrons about criteria for recognition.
2. **Existing Recognition Frameworks**: Review current criteria used in similar initiatives to inform new metrics.

### Outputs
1. **Clear Recognition Criteria**: Develop a documented set of criteria outlining how top contributors will be recognized.
2. **Evaluation Tool**: Create a simple evaluation tool or checklist for community use when nominating contributors based on defined metrics.

### Steps to Achieve the Goal
1. **Gather Feedback**: 
   - Start a discussion in the designated Discord channel to encourage submissions regarding effective recognition metrics.
   
2. **Review Best Practices**:
   - Analyze existing frameworks from similar initiatives to assess their effectiveness in recognizing contributions.
   
3. **Draft Criteria**:
   - Compile feedback and best practices into a draft document that captures proposed recognition metrics.

4. **Collaborative Refinement**:
   - Share the draft in the Discord channel for further input and finalize recognition criteria based on collective agreement.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure the finalized criteria and evaluation tool are documented and accessible in the KinOS environment.

### Key Relationships
- The recognition criteria must be practical, transparent, and reflect community values to ensure broad acceptance and effective implementation.

By following this structured approach, we can effectively establish recognition metrics that honor the contributions of patrons while fostering a collaborative community spirit.
