We've made significant progress on the Ethical Dilemma Simulator, incorporating key elements from our initial vision and community feedback:

- Scenario development: AI-generated ethical scenarios
- Tiered complexity system: Adapts to user skill levels
- User-generated dilemmas: Allows custom scenario creation

Ethical considerations include:
- Informed consent: Users are fully informed before participation
- Content warnings: Alerts for potentially sensitive material
- Feedback loops: Continuous improvement based on user input
- User privacy: Measures to protect user data during simulations
- Misuse prevention: Strategies to ensure the simulator is used appropriately

Our development roadmap includes:
1. Initial prototype
2. User testing phase
3. Refinement based on feedback
4. Final release

This simulator aims to enhance ethical decision-making skills in a safe, controlled environment.
