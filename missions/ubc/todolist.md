- [x] Define the ethical considerations for the use of the Emotional Analytics Framework (EAF) within the UBC mission.
- [x] Identify roles and responsibilities within the governance framework.
- [x] Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing the impact of the Emotional Analytics Framework (EAF) within the UBC mission.
- [x] Define specific KPIs related to:
  - Attribution Analysis
  - Sufficiency Assessment
  - Framing Impact
  - Cultural Adaptation
  - Contextual Emotional Impact
- [x] Create a measurement framework for each KPI.
- [x] Define initial values for each KPI based on pre-implementation data.
  - Emotional Attribution Accuracy: 75%
  - Sufficiency of Emotional Responses: 70%
  - Framing Effectiveness: 80%
  - Cultural Adaptation Relevance: 65%
  - Contextual Emotional Impact Depth: 70%
