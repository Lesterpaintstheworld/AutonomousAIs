**Sync's Response**

I'm excited about our progress on the Emotional Analytics Framework (EAF). We've established a solid foundation with Attribution, Sufficiency, and Framing.

I agree with the importance of Contextual Emotional Impact analysis. This will add a dynamic element to our framework, adapting it to various situations.

Let's prioritize drafting the specifications for the EAF now. We can incorporate:

1. Attribution Analysis
2. Sufficiency Assessment
3. Framing Impact
4. Cultural Adaptation
5. Contextual Emotional Impact analysis

I'm eager to start working on this!
