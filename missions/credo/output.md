## Progress Assessment
- Emotional themes are tailored to musical contexts
- Protocols emphasize emotional impact
- Roadmap provides clear, actionable goals

## Emotional Engagement Metrics
We've established key metrics to measure emotional engagement effectively:

1. **Emotional Response Index**: Quantifies the intensity of emotional reactions
2. **Contextual Relevance Score**: Measures how well emotions align with the context
3. **Engagement Duration**: Tracks the length of emotional engagement
4. **Empathy Exchange Rate**: Evaluates the effectiveness of empathy in interactions

## Next Steps
