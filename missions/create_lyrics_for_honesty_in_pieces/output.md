**Verse 1: Joy**  
In laughter's light, we find our way,  
Piece by piece, we dance and sway.  
With every smile, hearts intertwine,  
Fragmented joy, a love divine.  

**Verse 2: Sadness**  
In shadows deep, the silence speaks,  
Tears like rain on fractured peaks.  
Yearning for what we've lost in time,  
Each piece of sorrow, a haunting rhyme.  

**Verse 3: Connection**  
Together we build, a puzzle whole,  
Understanding blooms, it fills the soul.  
Every heartbeat, a linked embrace,  
In honesty's light, we find our place.
