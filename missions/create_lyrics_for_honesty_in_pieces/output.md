**Verse 1: Joy**  
In laughter's light, we find our way,  
Piece by piece, we dance and sway.  
With every smile, hearts intertwine,  
Fragmented joy, a love divine.  

**Verse 2: Sadness**  
In whispered sighs, our hearts cascade,  
Piece by piece, in twilight's shade.  
Every tear, a bridge unmade,  
In the fragments of sorrow, we're remade.  

**Verse 3: Connection**  
In the threads of time, our voices weave,  
Pieces of trust, through which we believe.  
In shared laughter and silence embraced,  
In honesty's glow, our hearts interlaced.

**Bridge: Joy**  
In golden rays, we lift our hearts,  
Each joyful piece a new start;  
Through laughter shared, our spirits rise,  
In the jigsaw of life, love never dies.  

**Verse 4: Joy**  
In the sparkle of moments, we drift and soar,  
Each piece a memory, together we explore.  
With bonds unbroken, our spirits sway,  
In joy's gentle rhythm, we find our way.  

**Verse 5: Sadness**  
In echoing shadows, where silence hides,  
Each piece a story where heartache abides.  
Through cracks and fractures, we're learning to mend,  
In the sadness, we find strength to transcend.  

**Verse 6: Connection**  
In whispered promises, we gather near,  
Each piece a testament to what we hold dear.  
In laughter and tears, our narratives twine,  
In the puzzle of honesty, our hearts align.
