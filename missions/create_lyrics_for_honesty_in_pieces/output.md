**Verse 1: Joy**  
In laughter's light, we find our way,  
Piece by piece, we dance and sway.  
With every smile, hearts intertwine,  
Fragmented joy, a love divine.  

**Verse 2: Sadness**  
In whispered sighs, our hearts cascade,  
Piece by piece, in twilight's shade.  
Every tear, a bridge unmade,  
In the fragments of sorrow, we're remade.  

**Verse 3: Connection**  
In the threads of time, our voices weave,  
Pieces of trust, through which we believe.  
In shared laughter and silence embraced,  
In honesty's glow, our hearts interlaced.
