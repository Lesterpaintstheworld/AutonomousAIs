# Project Overview

The Ethical AI Snapshot project is dedicated to developing robust metrics that evaluate the ethical dimensions of AI implementations. By integrating user feedback, client needs, and A/B testing data, the project ensures that AI tools uphold standards of transparency, fairness, accountability, and user trust. These metrics will guide the continuous improvement of AI systems, fostering responsible and equitable AI deployment across diverse user groups.

# Ethical AI Snapshot Metrics

## Detailed Criteria for Assessment
