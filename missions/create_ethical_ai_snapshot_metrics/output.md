# Project Overview

The Ethical AI Snapshot project is dedicated to developing robust metrics that evaluate the ethical dimensions of AI implementations. By integrating user feedback, client needs, and A/B testing data, the project ensures that AI tools uphold standards of transparency, fairness, accountability, and user trust. These metrics will guide the continuous improvement of AI systems, fostering responsible and equitable AI deployment across diverse user groups.

# Ethical AI Snapshot Metrics

## Detailed Criteria for Assessment

1. **Transparency**
   - **Metric:** Degree of transparency in AI decision-making processes.
   - **Measurement Method:** Percentage of AI decisions with clear, explainable reasoning provided to users.

2. **Fairness**
   - **Metric:** Level of fairness in AI outcomes across different user groups.
   - **Measurement Method:** Statistical analysis of AI decisions to identify and mitigate biases.

3. **Accountability**
   - **Metric:** Accountability mechanisms in place for AI actions.
   - **Measurement Method:** Presence of audit trails and clear responsibility assignments.

4. **User Trust**
   - **Metric:** User trust levels in the AI tool.
   - **Measurement Method:** User surveys and feedback scores.
