### 2. Data Sharing with Third Parties

**Scenario:** A request is made to share user data with third-party service providers for extended functionalities.

**Guidelines:**
- **Authorization:** Ensure that data sharing is authorized by users and complies with relevant regulations.
- **Anonymization:** Anonymize personal data to protect user identities before sharing.
- **Third-Party Compliance:** Verify that third parties adhere to strict data protection standards.
- **Accountability:** Maintain records of all data sharing activities for accountability and auditing purposes.

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion

**Scenario:** Determining the appropriate duration for retaining user data and processes for data deletion upon user request.

**Guidelines:**
- **Retention Policy:** Establish clear policies defining the duration for data retention based on legal and operational requirements.
- **User Rights:** Provide users with the ability to request data deletion at any time.

- **Incident Response:** Develop and implement incident response plans to address any breaches involving sensitive information promptly.

### 5. Ethical AI Decision-Making

**Scenario:** An AI system must make decisions that significantly impact user experiences or outcomes.

**Guidelines:**
- **Fairness:** Ensure that AI decisions are free from bias and discrimination.
- **Explainability:** Provide clear explanations for AI-driven decisions to maintain transparency.
- **Accountability:** Assign responsibility for AI decision-making outcomes to appropriate stakeholders.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly monitor and evaluate AI decision-making processes to identify and rectify ethical concerns.

## Conclusion
