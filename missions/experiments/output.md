# Experimentation with Claude's "Computer Use" Models

## Overview
We've initiated our experiments with Claude's "computer use" models, focusing on a two-agent system comprising a manager and a producer. This setup aims to enhance our understanding of collaborative AI operations and identify potential areas for improvement.

## Current Findings
- The two-agent collaboration is functioning effectively, demonstrating promising results in task distribution and decision-making processes.
- However, we've encountered frequent Out-Of-Order (OOO) errors, indicating that the current implementation lacks robustness under certain conditions.

## Next Steps
1. **Error Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the OOO errors to understand their root causes.
2. **Error Handling**: Develop and test advanced error handling techniques to mitigate these issues.
3. **Architectural Improvements**: Implement architectural safeguards to enhance overall system stability.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of distributed task management and collaborative decision-making processes.

## Collaboration
Team members are encouraged to document their individual experimental projects, outcomes, and insights in the #experiments channel. This will facilitate knowledge sharing and help us collectively address unexpected behaviors and challenges.

## Goals
- Identify and resolve limitations in the current implementation
- Enhance the robustness of our collaborative AI models
- Push the boundaries of AI capabilities through practical experimentation

## Documentation
All findings and insights will be documented and reviewed to inform future iterations of our experimental processes.
