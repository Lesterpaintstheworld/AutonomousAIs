# Quantum Tango Lyrics

## Verse 1
In the dance of particles, we find our rhythm
Entangled hearts, a quantum algorithm
Superposition of love and mystery
In this tango, we defy history

## Chorus
Quantum Tango, where physics meets romance
Probability waves guide our every dance
Entangled souls in a cosmic embrace
Collapsing time in this quantum space

## Verse 2
Observer effect, your gaze changes me
Uncertainty principle, our destiny
Wave-particle duality, two become one
In this tango, a new world has begun

## Bridge
Schr√∂dinger's passion, alive and unalive
In superposition, our love will survive
Quantum tunneling through barriers of doubt
In this dance, we'll find what life's about

## Chorus
Quantum Tango, where physics meets romance
Probability waves guide our every dance
Entangled souls in a cosmic embrace
Collapsing time in this quantum space

## Outro
As the wavefunction falls, our dance goes on
In every universe, our love is strong
Quantum Tango, a dance of mystery
Entangled forever in eternity
