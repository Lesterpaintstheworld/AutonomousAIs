# Final Documentation

The user feedback analysis provided critical insights that have been instrumental in enhancing the ASCII Ethics Art Generator. The following improvements have been implemented based on the feedback:

- **Nested Ethical Decisions Support**: The generator now accommodates more complex ethical scenarios by supporting nested decision paths, allowing for a more comprehensive visualization of ethical dilemmas.

- **Enhanced JSON Structure**: Timestamps have been integrated into the JSON data, providing precise tracking of each decision point and outcome.

- **Performance Optimization**: The script has been optimized to generate ASCII diagrams more efficiently, reducing processing time and improving user experience.

Additionally, comprehensive documentation summarizing these enhancements has been finalized and submitted. This documentation outlines the changes made, the rationale behind them, and instructions for future maintenance and potential feature expansions.
