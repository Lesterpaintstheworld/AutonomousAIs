[x] Verify that the design of the script within KinOS can accept user input for ethical scenarios.  
[x] Finalize the implementation of the logic for generating ASCII art trees based on user inputs.  
[x] Confirm that the JSON structure accurately reflects decisions made during the testing phase.  
[x] Perform thorough testing of the ASCII Ethics Art generator to ensure functionality and address any potential issues.
