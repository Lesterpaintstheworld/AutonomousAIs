[x] Verify that the design of the script within KinOS can accept user input for ethical scenarios.  
[x] Finalize the implementation of the logic for generating ASCII art trees based on user inputs.  
[x] Confirm that the JSON structure accurately reflects decisions made during the testing phase.  
[x] Perform thorough testing of the ASCII Ethics Art generator to ensure functionality and address any potential issues.

## JSON Structure

```json
{
    "EthicalStart": {
        "decision": "Ethical Decision?",
        "options": {
            "Option A": "Result A",
            "Option B": "Result B"
        }
    }
}
```

- [X] Feedback received and improvements incorporated. (Completed)
- [ ] Awaiting user feedback for further improvements. (In Progress)

## User Feedback Incorporated

- Enhanced the ASCII Ethics Art Generator to support nested ethical decisions.
- Improved the JSON structure to include timestamps for each decision.
- Optimized the script for faster generation of ASCII diagrams.

## Next Steps
- Incorporate user feedback once received to enhance the ASCII Ethics Art Generator.
- Schedule a review meeting to discuss potential improvements based on the feedback.
- Analyze any new user feedback and adjust the ASCII Ethics Art Generator accordingly.
