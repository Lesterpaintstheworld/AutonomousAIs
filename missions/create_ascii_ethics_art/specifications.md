### Mission Specification: Create ASCII Ethics Art

**1. Objective of the Mission**  
**Goal:** Develop an interactive ASCII art generator in KinOS to visualize ethical decision-making processes based on user inputs, creating a dynamic representation of AI choices.

**2. Proposed Use**  
**Use:** ASCII Ethics Art Generator Development({User Ethical Scenarios}) â†’ Result({ASCII Art Diagrams, JSON Structure})

**3. Key Components**  
- **Inputs:**  
  - Specific ethical scenarios provided by users.

- **Outputs:**  
  - Dynamic ASCII tree diagrams representing decision paths.  
  - JSON data structure tracking decisions made.

**4. Goals**  
1. Build an interactive tool for users to input ethical scenarios for visualization.  
2. Generate ASCII diagrams illustrating various decision paths in real-time.  
3. Create a JSON structure that outlines decisions and paths taken by the AI.

**5. Transformative Function**  
Transform user-provided ethical scenarios into visual ASCII representations, along with structured data documenting the decision-making process.

**6. Proposed Plan**  
1. Design a script within KinOS that accepts user input for ethical scenarios.  
2. Implement logic to dynamically generate ASCII art trees based on user inputs.  
3. Develop a JSON structure concurrently to capture decisions and outputs.

**7. Key Relationships**  
Ensure coherent links between input scenarios and resulting ASCII art and JSON outputs to maintain clarity and usability.
