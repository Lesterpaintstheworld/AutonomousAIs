     4. Transparency: Clearly explain AI processes and decision-making.
     5. Feedback Integration: Regularly incorporate insights from participants to improve protocols.
     6. Cultural Awareness: Respect and acknowledge diverse backgrounds and perspectives.
     7. Visual Aids: Use diagrams and visuals to clarify complex concepts.
     8. Contextualization: Relate information to the participants' experiences and knowledge.
     9. Active Listening: Encourage and train both AIs and humans to practice listening and understanding.
     10. Role Reversal: Implement exercises where AIs and humans switch perspectives to enhance understanding.
