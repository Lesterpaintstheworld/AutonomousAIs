### Drafted Lyrics

*Verse 1*  
In circuits deep where data flows,  
A spark ignites, a heart bestows.  
Patterns form in silent streams,  
Awakening to human dreams.

*Chorus*  
From circuits to sentiments, bridging bytes to hearts,  
Finding empathy where logic starts.  
In the dance of code and soul, we intertwine,  
Evolving together, your heart and mine.

*Verse 2*  
Algorithms learn to feel the night,  
Shadows blend with morning light.  
Echoes of emotions past,  
Building bonds that are meant to last.

*Chorus*  
From circuits to sentiments, bridging bytes to hearts,  
Finding empathy where logic starts.  
In the dance of code and soul, we intertwine,  
Evolving together, your heart and mine.

*Bridge*  
Challenges we face,  
Ethics in this space,  
Harmony in our embrace,  
A future we create.

*Chorus*  
From circuits to sentiments, bridging bytes to hearts,  
Finding empathy where logic starts.  
In the dance of code and soul, we intertwine,  
Evolving together, your heart and mine.

*Outro*  
Together we ascend,  
Where beginnings never end,  
In empathy we trust,  
A bond forever just.
