## Project Overview

### Objective
- **Goal**: Foster continuous learning and adaptation within the community by initiating a daily practice of planting metaphorical seeds, each representing a core value or theme relevant to communal growth.

### Expected Result
- **Outcome**: A vibrant community space where members actively discuss core values.
- **Characteristics**: Regular participation, thematic discussions, and evolving values.

3. **Documentation**: Maintain a record of discussions to track the growth of community values.

### Key Relationships
