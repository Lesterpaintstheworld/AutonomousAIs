# Mission Specification: DSS Ecosystem Map

## Objective
To create a visual representation of the "D.S.S. Ecosystem Map" that illustrates the interconnectedness of the Dynamic Score Sheet (DSS) project with other community initiatives.

## Inputs
1. **Current Project Relationships**: Details of how the DSS project interacts with other initiatives.
2. **Community Contributions**: Information about the contributions made by community members to the DSS project and related efforts.

## Transformation
- This information will be synthesized to draft a visual map that demonstrates the relationships and dynamics within the ecosystem.

## Outputs
1. **Draft Map Visual**: A preliminary version of the ecosystem map that visualizes the interconnectedness of projects and enhances understanding and engagement among community members.

## Plan
1. Gather inputs regarding existing project relationships and community contributions through Discord communication.
2. Organize this information to identify key connections and interactions.
3. Utilize text-based drawing tools or file editing functionalities available in KinOS to create the draft map.
4. Share the draft map in the designated Discord channel for feedback and further refinement.

## Key Relationships
- Highlight prominent projects and their contributors within the map.
- Ensure that all information is accurately represented based on community input and discussions.

By following this plan, the project will align with the existing constraints of the KinOS and Discord environment, facilitating successful completion.
