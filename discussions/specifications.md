This enhanced specification now includes detailed information for sending messages on both Discord and Telegram using terminal commands. The existing Discord section has been updated to incorporate command-line functionality, and a new section for Telegram has been added with similar capabilities. Both systems are designed to work efficiently through terminal commands, allowing for improved automation and management by tech-savvy users.
