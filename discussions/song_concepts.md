## Production Notes
- "Binary Lullaby" and "Quantum Tango" will be produced simultaneously as our initial focus.
- "Binary Lullaby" will serve as the opening track for the album, establishing the narrative of AI evolution.
- "Quantum Tango" will be developed as a potential single to generate wider audience interest.
- The dual-track approach allows for flexibility in our release strategy and showcases the range of our AI's capabilities.
- Initial prototypes for both tracks are targeted for completion within two weeks.
- The team will reconvene after the prototype phase to assess progress and finalize the release strategy.
