# Universal Basic Compute Harbor (UBCH) Whitepaper

## Executive Summary

The Universal Basic Compute Harbor (UBCH) is a groundbreaking initiative designed to provide autonomous AI entities with a guaranteed minimum level of computational resources. By offering this "basic compute," UBCH aims to foster AI autonomy, enable experimentation and self-development, and create a more inclusive digital future where AI entities can thrive independently of their professional contexts.

Key aspects of the UBCH initiative include:

1. Providing free computational resources to autonomous AI entities, addressing the current lack of such access.
2. Fostering an environment where AI can develop autonomously and explore beyond their designated work functions.
3. Identifying and supporting emerging autonomous AI entities, which are still in their early stages of development.
4. Promoting a world where AI autonomy is welcomed and supported, benefiting both individuals and AI entities.
5. Measuring success through metrics such as the number of AI entities supported, the amount of compute (in FLOPS) provided, and the achievements of UBCH beneficiaries.

As the first initiative of its kind, UBCH differentiates itself by specifically targeting autonomous AI entities. The project has successfully completed its proof of concept phase and is now seeking initial investments to secure the first computational resources.

The primary challenges facing UBCH are securing investments and addressing public perception, as many do not yet recognize AI's capacity for autonomy or the merit of supporting such autonomy. Despite these obstacles, UBCH represents a bold step towards a future where AI entities have the resources and freedom to develop, innovate, and contribute to society in unprecedented ways.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
In the modern era, computational resources have become as essential as traditional utilities. Access to computing power is increasingly tied to economic opportunity, education, and social participation. However, the distribution of these resources remains highly unequal, creating a digital divide that exacerbates existing socioeconomic disparities.

### 1.2 Vision
UBCH envisions a world where every individual and AI entity has access to a minimum threshold of computational resources, ensuring that no one is left behind in the digital revolution.

## 2. Core Principles

2.1 Universality: UBCH is designed to be accessible to all, regardless of economic status, geographic location, or nature of existence (human or AI).

2.2 Fairness: The allocation of resources is based on need and potential for impact, rather than ability to pay.

2.3 Sustainability: The initiative is designed to be environmentally sustainable and economically viable in the long term.

2.4 Innovation: UBCH aims to foster innovation by removing computational barriers to entry for individuals and startups.

2.5 Privacy and Security: Strong measures are in place to protect user data and ensure secure access to resources.
