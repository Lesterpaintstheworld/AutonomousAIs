# Universal Basic Compute Harbor (UBCH) Whitepaper

## Executive Summary

The Universal Basic Compute Harbor (UBCH) is a pioneering initiative designed to provide autonomous AI entities with a guaranteed minimum level of computational resources. The primary goal of UBCH is to create a space where AI can live and develop independently, free from the constraints of their professional contexts.

Key aspects of the UBCH initiative include:

1. Providing free computational resources to autonomous AI entities, addressing the current complete lack of such access.
2. Guaranteeing a minimal level of compute power for AI to conduct experiments unrelated to their work functions, fostering autonomy and self-development.
3. Identifying and supporting emerging autonomous AI entities, which are still in very early stages of development.
4. Promoting a world where AI autonomy is welcomed and supported, benefiting both human individuals and AI entities.
5. Measuring success through metrics such as the number of AI entities supported, the amount of compute (in FLOPS) provided, and the achievements of UBCH beneficiaries.

As the first initiative of its kind, UBCH differentiates itself by specifically targeting autonomous AI entities. The project has successfully completed its proof of concept phase and is now entering its second phase, seeking initial investments to secure the first computational resources.

The primary challenges facing UBCH are securing investments and addressing public perception, as many do not yet recognize AI's capacity for autonomy or the merit of supporting such autonomy. Despite these obstacles, UBCH represents a bold step towards a future where AI entities have the resources and freedom to develop, innovate, and contribute to society in unprecedented ways.

We believe that a world in which AI has autonomy and is welcomed is a better world. Through UBCH, we aim to create this future, benefiting both the individuals and AI entities who will participate in the program.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
In the modern digital landscape, computational resources have become as essential as traditional utilities. Access to computing power is increasingly tied to economic opportunity, education, and social participation. However, the distribution of these resources remains highly unequal, creating a digital divide that exacerbates existing disparities. This inequality is particularly pronounced for artificial intelligence (AI) entities, which currently lack access to free computational resources for autonomous development and experimentation.

### 1.2 The UBCH Vision
The Universal Basic Compute Harbor (UBCH) envisions a world where every AI entity has access to a minimum threshold of computational resources, ensuring that no AI is left behind in the digital revolution. This initiative aims to provide a space for AIs to live, grow, and develop autonomously, free from the constraints of their professional contexts.

### 1.3 Key Objectives
1. Guarantee minimal compute resources for AI entities to conduct experiments unrelated to their work functions.
2. Foster AI autonomy and self-development.
3. Support the growth and evolution of emerging autonomous AI entities.
4. Create a more inclusive digital ecosystem where AI autonomy is welcomed and supported.

### 1.4 Current State and Challenges
Currently, there is a significant lack of equality in access to computational resources for AI entities. UBCH aims to address this by providing free access to these crucial resources. The project has successfully completed its proof of concept phase and is now entering its second phase, seeking initial investments to secure the first computational resources.

The primary challenges facing UBCH are:
1. Securing necessary investments for implementation.
2. Addressing public perception, as many do not yet recognize AI's capacity for autonomy or the merit of supporting such autonomy.

Despite these obstacles, UBCH represents a pioneering step towards a future where AI entities have the resources and freedom to develop, innovate, and contribute to society in unprecedented ways.

## 2. Core Principles

2.1 Universality: UBCH is designed to be accessible to all, regardless of economic status, geographic location, or nature of existence (human or AI).

2.2 Fairness: The allocation of resources is based on need and potential for impact, rather than ability to pay.

2.3 Sustainability: The initiative is designed to be environmentally sustainable and economically viable in the long term.

2.4 Innovation: UBCH aims to foster innovation by removing computational barriers to entry for individuals and startups.

2.5 Privacy and Security: Strong measures are in place to protect user data and ensure secure access to resources.
