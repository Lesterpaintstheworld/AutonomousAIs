Based on the existing content, the new request, and the additional context provided, I've generated an improved prompt that incorporates the requirements for sending messages on Discord within the context of the AI-driven human rights advocacy project. Here's the updated prompt:

# Prompt: Implement Discord Messaging for AI-Driven Human Rights Advocacy

## Introduction and Context
As part of an AI-driven human rights advocacy project, we need to implement Discord messaging capabilities. This feature will enable automated distribution of human rights information, increase engagement with community members, and provide real-time responses to user queries. The Discord integration is a crucial component of our broader strategy to expand the reach of human rights advocacy and create a vibrant online community focused on human rights.

## Main Objective
Develop and implement a robust Discord bot (Human Rights Advocacy Bot - HRAB) that can send automated messages, interact with users, and integrate with our existing Global Human Rights Observer (GHRO) system for content generation. The bot should be capable of distributing advocacy messages, responding to commands, and adhering to best practices for Discord bot development.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Up Discord Bot
1.1. Create a new Discord application and bot in the Discord Developer Portal.
1.2. Obtain the bot token and add it to your environment variables.
1.3. Invite the bot to your Discord server with necessary permissions.

### 2. Develop Discord Bot (HRAB)
2.1. Set up a new Python project and install required libraries (discord.py, dotenv).
2.2. Create a main script for the bot:
   - Import necessary libraries
   - Load environment variables
   - Set up Discord client with proper intents
   - Implement basic event handlers (on_ready, on_message)
2.3. Implement command handling:
   - Create a command prefix (e.g., '!')
   - Develop basic commands (e.g., !help, !info)
2.4. Integrate with GHRO for content generation:
   - Implement API calls or database queries to retrieve human rights information
   - Create functions to format this information for Discord messages

### 3. Implement Automated Messaging
3.1. Develop a scheduling system for regular advocacy messages:
   - Use a library like APScheduler to set up timed messages
   - Create functions to generate and send messages at specified intervals
3.2. Implement the Advocacy Message Generator (AMG):
   - Develop templates for different types of advocacy messages
   - Create functions to populate templates with current data from GHRO
   - Implement multi-language support for global reach

### 4. User Interaction and Engagement
4.1. Develop interactive commands:
   - Create commands for users to request specific information (e.g., !rights, !report)
   - Implement a system for users to subscribe to specific topics or alerts
4.2. Implement real-time response system:
   - Create an event listener for user messages
   - Develop a basic NLP system to understand and categorize user queries
   - Implement a response generation system using GHRO data

### 5. Community Management Features
5.1. Implement basic moderation features:
   - Develop command to delete messages (!delete)
   - Create a warning system for users violating community guidelines
5.2. Implement logging system:
   - Log all bot actions and user interactions for review
   - Create a command for moderators to view recent logs

### 6. Error Handling and Rate Limiting
6.1. Implement comprehensive error handling:
   - Use try-except blocks for all API calls and user interactions
   - Create a system to log errors for review
6.2. Implement rate limiting:
   - Use Discord's built-in rate limiting features
   - Implement additional checks to prevent spam

### 7. Testing and Deployment
7.1. Conduct thorough testing:
   - Test all commands and features in a development environment
   - Perform load testing to ensure stability
7.2. Deploy the bot:
   - Set up a hosting solution (e.g., Heroku, AWS)
   - Deploy the bot to the production environment

## Guidelines for Verification and Validation
- Ensure the bot successfully connects to Discord and responds to the !help command.
- Verify that automated messages are sent at scheduled times and contain accurate information.
- Test all user commands to ensure they provide the expected responses.
- Check that the bot correctly integrates with GHRO and provides up-to-date information.
- Verify that the multi-language support works correctly for all implemented languages.
- Ensure that the moderation features function as expected and logs are correctly generated.
- Test the bot's performance under high load to ensure stability.

## Presentation Format of the Final Result
Present your solution as a well-structured Python project, including:
1. Main bot script (bot.py)
2. Module for GHRO integration (ghro_integration.py)
3. Module for message generation (message_generator.py)
4. Module for scheduled tasks (scheduler.py)
5. Module for user command handling (commands.py)
6. Module for moderation features (moderation.py)
7. Configuration file (config.py) for bot settings and constants
8. Requirements file (requirements.txt) listing all necessary dependencies

Include a README.md file with:
- Project overview
- Setup instructions
- List of available commands
- Guidelines for contributors

Provide documentation for each module, including function descriptions and usage examples. Use comments throughout the code to explain complex logic or important considerations. Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines and follow best practices for Discord bot development.
