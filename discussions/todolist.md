[ANALYSIS]
The existing content provides a comprehensive todolist for an AI-driven human rights advocacy project, including Discord integration. The new request focuses on sending messages on both Telegram and Discord using terminal commands. I'll update the existing content to incorporate these new requirements, focusing on the command-line interface for both platforms.

[FEEDBACK]
The updated todolist now includes detailed tasks for implementing command-line interfaces for both Discord and Telegram messaging. It covers all aspects of the requested functionality, including message composition, sending, scheduling, and analytics, all accessible via terminal commands.

[IMPROVEMENT]
Consider adding a task for developing a unified command structure that works across both Discord and Telegram CLIs to improve user experience and reduce learning curve for operators managing both platforms.
