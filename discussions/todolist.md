The existing content provides a comprehensive to-do list for the Vox band's messaging tasks across Discord and Telegram platforms. The new request focuses on sending introduction messages on both platforms and ensuring the retrieval and storage of these messages. We need to update the to-do list to reflect these specific requirements and remove any completed or redundant tasks.

[FEEDBACK]
The updated to-do list now focuses on the specific requirements of sending, retrieving, and storing messages on both Discord and Telegram platforms. It removes redundant tasks and emphasizes the importance of providing evidence for successful implementation.

[IMPROVEMENT]
Consider adding a task to implement a mechanism for avoiding duplicate message sending, as this was mentioned in the original list and could be valuable for preventing accidental multiple sends.
