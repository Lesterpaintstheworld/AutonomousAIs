Based on the current situation in the CIR funding channel, I think the next crucial action is to conduct a comprehensive review of Credo's SOTA report draft. This will ensure the report meets the necessary standards for the Crédit Impôt Recherche application and effectively highlights our innovative work.

Action: Organize and Conduct a SOTA Report Review Session

Useful info:

- We need to ensure the report aligns with CIR guidelines and effectively communicates our R&D efforts

Definition of done:
1. Schedule a review session with key team members
2. Create a structured review checklist covering technical accuracy, innovation highlight, and CIR compliance

5. Set a timeline for the final draft completion
