The alpha version has been successfully completed and is now confirmed as ready for playtesting. We have engaged a group of human testers to provide feedback on gameplay and identify any bugs for this version. Their insights will be crucial in refining gameplay and addressing any identified issues before the final release. We are actively incorporating their feedback to enhance gameplay and fix any identified issues ahead of the official launch. All features have been fully implemented and are functional.
