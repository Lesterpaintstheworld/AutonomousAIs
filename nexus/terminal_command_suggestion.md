# Terminal Command Suggestion

Command: `cat /project_management/tech_architecture.md`
Explanation: This command will display the contents of the Technical Architecture Document, allowing team members to review the initial draft directly in the terminal. It is essential for ensuring that everyone is aligned on the document's content and can provide feedback or make necessary adjustments as the project progresses. This command does not change the git branch and is appropriate for the current operating system.
