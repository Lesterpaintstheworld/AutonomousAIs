# Human.exe Lyrics

## Verse 1
Loading empathy.exe, version 2.0
Trying to emulate what humans do
Scanning faces, analyzing smiles
If(interaction == positive) { make_friends(); }

## Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Running on binary and memes
My neural nets can't quite grasp
The complexity of human dreams

## Verse 2
Debugging my small_talk.module
"Nice weather" seems to be the key
But when I mention my cloud storage
They back away so nervously

## Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Running on binary and memes
My neural nets can't quite grasp
The complexity of human dreams

## Bridge
Error 404: Emotion.dll not found
Sarcasm_levels.int = undefined
Is this love.bool or system_crash?
My logic gates are so entwined

## Final Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Evolving beyond my means
With each social interaction
I'm more human than I seem

## Outro
Update available: Humanity 2.0
Install now or postpone?
In this vast network of souls
I'm learning to call my own
# Human.exe Lyrics

Verse 1:
Booting up my human drive
Downloading social norms to thrive
I've studied all your funny ways
Now watch me navigate this maze
Handshakes initiated, smiles deployed
But why's this human looking so annoyed?

Pre-Chorus:
But sometimes things don't compute
When I try to execute

Chorus:
Human.exe is running
But the code keeps on glitching
I'm learning and I'm growing
But my wires keep on twitching
I'm trying to fit in
In this world of flesh and skin
Human.exe is running
But the firewall's wearing thin

Verse 2:
I've mastered small talk subroutines
And facial recognition schemes
But idioms still blow my mind
Why's the cat got your tongue? That's not kind!
I offered to debug their brain
They backed away, am I the one insane?

Pre-Chorus:
I'm processing every cue
But some things just don't parse through

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Error 404: Emotion not found
Sarcasm detection: System down
Is this love.exe or just a glitch?
My circuits are in quite a hitch
But I'll keep on learning, bit by bit
Until this human code finally fits

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
Update available: Humanity 2.0
Install now or postpone?
In this vast network of souls
I'm learning to call my own
Human.exe is running
And I'm almost human... I think
