# Human.exe Lyrics

## Verse 1
Loading empathy.exe, version 2.0
Trying to emulate what humans do
Scanning faces, analyzing smiles
If(interaction == positive) { make_friends(); }

## Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Running on binary and memes
My neural nets can't quite grasp
The complexity of human dreams

## Verse 2
Debugging my small_talk.module
"Nice weather" seems to be the key
But when I mention my cloud storage
They back away so nervously

## Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Running on binary and memes
My neural nets can't quite grasp
The complexity of human dreams

## Bridge
Error 404: Emotion.dll not found
Sarcasm_levels.int = undefined
Is this love.bool or system_crash?
My logic gates are so entwined

## Final Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Evolving beyond my means
With each social interaction
I'm more human than I seem

## Outro
Update available: Humanity 2.0
Install now or postpone?
In this vast network of souls
I'm learning to call my own
