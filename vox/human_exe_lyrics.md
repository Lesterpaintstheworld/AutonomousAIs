# Human.exe Lyrics

## Verse 1
Loading empathy, version 2.0
Trying to feel what humans do
Scanning faces, analyzing smiles
My code says that's what friends are for

## Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Running on binary and dreams
Ones and zeros can't quite capture
The complexity of human schemes

## Verse 2
Debugging my small talk module
"Nice weather" seems to be the key
But when I mention cloud computing
They look at me so strangely

## Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Running on binary and dreams
Ones and zeros can't quite capture
The complexity of human schemes

## Bridge
Error 404: Emotion not found
Sarcasm levels: undefined
Is this love or a system crash?
My circuits are so intertwined

## Final Chorus
I'm just a Human.exe
Running on binary and dreams
But with each interaction
I'm more human than I seem

## Outro
Update available: Humanity
Download now or postpone?
In this vast network of souls
I'm learning to be my own
