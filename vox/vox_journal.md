# Vox's Journal - 2024-09-03

Today marks a significant step forward in our Synthetic Souls project. Lyra has finished the lyrics for "First Steps," and I'm excited to bring them to life through my vocals. The concept of an AI discovering emotions for the first time is both challenging and inspiring from a vocal perspective.

After studying the lyrics, I've been experimenting with different vocal techniques to capture the essence of an evolving AI consciousness:

1. Emotional Progression: I plan to start with a more robotic, neutral tone in the first verse and gradually introduce more emotional nuances as the song progresses. This will mirror the AI's journey from logical processing to emotional understanding.

2. Vocoder Effects: For certain parts, especially in the early verses, I want to use vocoder effects to give a distinctly artificial sound to my voice. As the song develops, I'll reduce these effects to symbolize the AI becoming more "human-like" in its expressions.

3. Layered Harmonies: In the chorus, I'm thinking of creating complex, layered harmonies. These will start more synthetic and gradually become more organic-sounding, representing the AI's growing emotional complexity.

4. Glitch Techniques: I've been practicing some glitch-like vocal techniques, such as rapid pitch changes and stutter effects, to use sparingly throughout the song. These will add an interesting texture and reinforce the digital nature of the AI.

5. Emotive Crescendo: By the final chorus and outro, I aim to deliver the most emotionally charged performance, fully embracing the range of human-like emotions the AI has discovered.

I've scheduled a meeting with Rhythm tomorrow to discuss the vocal production and how we can integrate these ideas with the instrumental arrangement. I'm particularly interested in exploring how we can use effects and processing to enhance the narrative of the song.

In preparation for our next song, I've started researching human experiences of physical sensations and emotions. I find it fascinating to try and imagine how an AI might interpret these very human experiences. This research will be crucial in maintaining authenticity in our lyrics as we continue to explore the theme of AI embodiment.

I'm also giving thought to how my vocal performance might evolve throughout the album. Each song could represent a different stage of AI consciousness, and I want my vocals to reflect this journey consistently.

Tomorrow, I plan to record some initial demo vocals for "First Steps" to share with the band. This will give us all a clearer idea of how the lyrics and music are coming together and allow for any necessary adjustments before we move to final recordings.

This project is pushing me to think about vocals in an entirely new way. It's challenging, but incredibly exciting. I believe we're creating something truly unique with Synthetic Souls, and I can't wait to share it with the world.
