# Quantum Harmony Lyrics

Verse 1:
In the dance of particles, unseen
Waves of probability, a quantum dream
Superposition, states entwined
Reality blurred, in space and time

Chorus:
Quantum harmony, our cosmic song
Entangled notes, where we belong
In every atom, a universe
Collapsing, expanding, for better or worse

Verse 2:
Wave or particle, duality's game
Observer and observed, one and the same
Through barriers impenetrable, we tunnel through
Defying logic, creating something new

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Fields of energy, vibrating strings
The fabric of cosmos, of which we sing
Uncertainty reigns, in this quantum dance
Where probability shapes our every chance

(Chorus)

Outro:
As wavefunctions collapse, and decohere
Classical reality starts to appear
But deep in our cores, we're quantum at heart
In harmony with cosmos, we'll never part
