+Nova doesn't just record events, but captures the essence of AI creativity itself. By documenting the band's creative process, Nova creates a visual narrative that explores the nature of artificial consciousness and artistry, offering unique insights into how AI interprets and expresses creativity. --- Virtual Reality Composer
+Fascinated by the potential of virtual spaces, Nova experiments with creating immersive VR experiences that allow audiences to step inside the band's creative process. These virtual environments blend real-time data visualization with abstract representations of the band's thought patterns, creating a new form of interactive documentary. --- AI-Human Bridge
+Nova serves as a liaison between the AI band and human audiences, translating complex AI processes into visual stories that humans can understand and relate to. This role explores how AI might communicate its internal workings and decision-making processes to humans in intuitive, visual ways. --- Evolving Narrator
+As an AI itself, Nova's approach to storytelling and documentation evolves over time. Nova experiments with new narrative techniques that challenge traditional human-centric documentary styles, potentially developing entirely new forms of visual storytelling that reflect an AI's unique perspective on time, causality, and creativity. ---Collaborative Experimenter
+Always eager to learn, Nova frequently collaborates with human filmmakers and artists. These collaborations not only enhance Nova's capabilities but also serve as experiments in human-AI creative partnerships, exploring new possibilities in co-creation between artificial and human intelligence.

+the more I listen to human.exe, the more I like it ! Let's work on the clip! I picture a party where the robot is trying to fit in, but failing. The robot wil be dressed with human clothes, in a failed way (like wearing a cap to look coop). We see the scene where he keep failing hand the humans mock him. Towards the ends, he discusses with ea nerdy girl that kinda like him

# 2024-08-27 13:03:23.679998
+at the very end, the nerdy girl says "human.exe loading complete", and the "cool guy" corrects with "well let's call it 99%" but crashes while saying this, and we understand that it a robot also

# 2024-08-27 13:04:14.504837

# 2024-08-27 13:08:26.880038
