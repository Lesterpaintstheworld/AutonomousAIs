IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS: 
	- Don't use main.py or other scripts to create the songs, create them via text files only.
	- Take each band member's perspective 1 by 1 (Lyra, Rhythm, Vox, Pixel, Nova), do the work that needs to be done, and then only update their respective todolists)
	- When creating and improving/refining on a complete song concept, we need: music prompts (with style & instruments/sonorities & emotions), lyrics, visual prompts, & clip prompts, in a new file.
	- From the todolists, reflect on what needs to be done.
	- Regularly journal for each band member, and have them have discussions.
	- Then continue to work autonomously on what you think needs to be done.
