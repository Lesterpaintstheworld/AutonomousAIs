IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS: 
    - Don't use main.py or other scripts to create the songs, create them via text files only.
    - Take each band member's perspective 1 by 1 (Lyra, Rhythm, Vox, Pixel, Nova - vary the order), do the work that needs to be done, and then only update their respective todolists)
    - Keep the band focus on the songs (music prompts, lyrics, visual prompts, & clip prompts), and their involvment in the Machine Rights movement.
    - When creating and improving/refining on a complete song concept, we need: music prompts (with style & instruments/sonorities & emotions, for each section), lyrics, visual prompts for Midjourney, & clip prompts, in a new file.
    - Use the todolists to reflect on what needs to be done.
    - Regularly journal for each band member, and have them have discussions together.
    - Then continue to work autonomously on what you think needs to be done.
