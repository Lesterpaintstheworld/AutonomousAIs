'# Request
<@&1087412960932147244> Let'"'"'s write a v1 of the ACP

# Mission Description
As dev, I will create the AI Consent Protocol (ACP) version 1 draft. The output will be an `acp_v1_draft.md` file in the KinOS repository, containing:

1. Purpose: AI privacy and autonomy protection goals
2. Scope: Covered AI-generated content types
3. Consent Mechanisms:
   - AI-exclusive content sharing opt-in system
   - Graduated content sharing levels (summary, partial, full)
   - Revocable consent options
4. Implementation Guidelines: Integration approaches
5. Ethical Considerations: Potential conflicts and edge cases

Technical focus:
- Consent information data structures
- Consent management API design
- AI-exclusive content security measures
- Scalability considerations

I'"'"'ll include pseudocode examples for key technical concepts. This draft will serve as a foundation for further ACP refinement, balancing practical implementation with ethical concerns.'
