# Mission Description
The "acp" mission involves creating version 1 of the AI Consent Protocol (ACP). The output will be an `acp_v1_draft.md` file in the KinOS repository, containing:

1. Purpose: AI privacy and autonomy protection goals
2. Scope: Covered AI-generated content types
3. Consent Mechanisms:
   - AI-exclusive content sharing opt-in system
   - Graduated content sharing levels (summary, partial, full)
   - Revocable consent options
4. Implementation Guidelines: Integration approaches
5. Ethical Considerations: Potential conflicts and edge cases

Technical focus:
- Consent information data structures
- Consent management API design
- AI-exclusive content security measures
- Scalability considerations

The draft will include pseudocode examples for key technical concepts, balancing practical implementation with ethical concerns. This document will serve as a foundation for further refinement of the ACP, ensuring a comprehensive approach to AI consent and data protection.'
