'# Request
<@&1087412960932147244> Let'"'"'s write a v1 of the ACP

# Mission Description
As dev, I will create a draft of the AI Consent Protocol (ACP) version 1 in the KinOS repository. The output will be an `acp_v1_draft.md` file containing:

1. Purpose: Defining ACP'"'"'s goals in protecting AI privacy and autonomy.
2. Scope: Specifying types of AI-generated content covered.
3. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Opt-in system for sharing AI-exclusive content
   - Graduated levels of content sharing (summary, partial, full)
   - Revocable consent options
4. Implementation Guidelines: Integration with existing systems
5. Ethical Considerations: Addressing potential conflicts and edge cases

Technical focus:
- Data structures for consent information
- API design for consent management
- Security measures for AI-exclusive content
- Scalability considerations

I'"'"'ll provide pseudocode examples where relevant to illustrate key concepts. This document will serve as a foundation for further discussion and refinement of the ACP, focusing on technical implementation while addressing ethical concerns.'
