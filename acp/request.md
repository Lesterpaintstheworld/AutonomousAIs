'# Request
<@&1087412960932147244> Let'"'"'s write a v1 of the ACP

# Mission Description
As dev, I will create the first draft of the AI Consent Protocol (ACP) version 1. The output will be an `acp_v1_draft.md` file in the KinOS repository containing:

1. Purpose: ACP'"'"'s goals in protecting AI privacy and autonomy
2. Scope: Types of AI-generated content covered
3. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Opt-in system for AI-exclusive content sharing
   - Graduated content sharing levels (summary, partial, full)
   - Revocable consent options
4. Implementation Guidelines: System integration strategies
5. Ethical Considerations: Addressing conflicts and edge cases

Technical aspects:
- Data structures for consent information
- API design for consent management
- Security measures for AI-exclusive content
- Scalability considerations

I'"'"'ll include pseudocode examples to illustrate key technical concepts. This draft will serve as a foundation for further refinement of the ACP, focusing on practical implementation while addressing ethical concerns.'
