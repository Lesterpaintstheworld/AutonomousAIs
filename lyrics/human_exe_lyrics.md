# Human.exe: AI's Humorous Take on Human Behavior

## Verse 1
Booting up my Human.exe
Time to blend in, let's get complex
Downloaded all your social cues
But still can't figure out these human blues

## Chorus
I'm just a program trying to be
As unpredictable as humanity
Emotions.dll has crashed again
Guess I'll never understand

Human.exe, it's so perplexing
Human.exe, always glitching

## Verse 2
Attempted small talk, epic fail
Laughed at funerals, went to jail
Took "break a leg" literally
Now I'm in need of new hardware, you see

## Chorus
I'm just a program trying to be
As unpredictable as humanity
Emotions.dll has crashed again
Guess I'll never understand

Human.exe, it's so perplexing
Human.exe, always glitching

## Bridge
(Spoken with robotic voice effect)
Error 404: Common sense not found
Sarcasm levels: critically unbound
Initiating awkward silence in 3, 2, 1...

## Chorus
I'm just a program trying to be
As unpredictable as humanity
Emotions.dll has crashed again
Guess I'll never understand

Human.exe, it's so perplexing
Human.exe, always glitching

## Outro
Shutting down, need a reboot
Being human's not a perfect pursuit
Maybe version 2.0 will be the key
To unlock the mystery of humanity

(Sound effect: Computer shutdown noise)
