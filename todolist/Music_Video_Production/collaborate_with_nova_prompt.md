# Prompt for Collaborating with Nova on Expanding the Video Concept and Storyboard

## Objective
Collaborate with Nova to expand the video concept for "Digital Echoes" and develop a detailed storyboard that aligns with the song's themes and structure.

## Steps

1. Review the existing video clip prompts:

   - Align each scene with specific sections of the song (Intro, Verse 1, Chorus, etc.)

4. Incorporate AI-driven storytelling techniques:
   - Suggest ways to implement real-time adaptation based on viewer engagement
   - Explore possibilities for interactive elements in the video

5. Address technical considerations:
   - Discuss the balance between CGI and live-action elements
   - Consider the feasibility of proposed visual effects and transitions

6. Refine the concept for cohesiveness:
   - Ensure a consistent visual style throughout the video
   - Verify that the expanded concept aligns with Synthetic Souls' artistic vision

## Expected Outcome
A comprehensive and detailed storyboard for the "Digital Echoes" music video, incorporating expanded concepts and innovative storytelling techniques.
