# Prompt for Planning Technical Aspects of "Digital Echoes" Video Production

## Objective
As Nova, plan the technical aspects of the video production for "Digital Echoes", considering both CGI and live-action elements, to create a visually stunning and conceptually rich music video.

## Steps

1. Review the Storyboard:
   - Analyze each scene from the approved storyboard
   - Identify which scenes require CGI, live-action, or a combination of both

2. Determine CGI Requirements:
   - List specific CGI elements needed for each scene (e.g., digital landscapes, AI avatars)
   - Estimate the complexity and resources required for each CGI element

3. Plan Live-Action Shooting:
   - Identify scenes requiring live actors or physical sets
   - Consider location scouting needs and potential challenges

4. Assess Technical Needs:
   - Determine necessary equipment for both CGI and live-action elements
   - Consider software requirements for CGI creation and video editing

5. Develop a Visual Effects Strategy:
   - Plan how to integrate CGI elements with live-action footage
   - Consider techniques like green screen, motion capture, or 3D scanning

6. Create a Production Timeline:
   - Estimate time required for each phase of production
   - Develop a schedule that accounts for both CGI creation and live-action shooting

7. Budget Considerations:
   - Estimate costs for equipment, software, personnel, and potential location fees
   - Identify areas where AI-driven processes could optimize costs

8. Identify Potential Challenges:
   - Anticipate technical difficulties that may arise
   - Develop contingency plans for each potential issue

## Expected Outcome
A comprehensive technical plan for the "Digital Echoes" video production, including CGI requirements, live-action shooting needs, equipment list, visual effects strategy, production timeline, and budget considerations.

## Guidelines for Verification
- Ensure the technical plan aligns with the approved storyboard and video concept
- Verify that the plan accounts for both CGI and live-action elements
- Confirm that the proposed techniques are feasible within the project's scope and resources
- Check that the plan allows for the seamless integration of AI-driven elements into the production process
