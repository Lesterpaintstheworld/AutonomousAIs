# Prompt for Assisting Rhythm in Translating Music Prompts into a Full Composition

## Objective
Guide Rhythm in creating a full composition for "Digital Echoes" based on the provided music prompts, ensuring the final piece aligns with the band's vision and concept.

## Steps

1. Review the music prompts:
   - Style: Electronic pop with elements of ambient and industrial music
   - Tempo: Moderate (around 110 BPM)
   - Key: A minor
   - Section-specific instructions (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Outro)

2. Develop the basic structure:
   - Create a skeleton arrangement following the song structure
   - Implement the core rhythmic elements and tempo

3. Compose the main melodic themes:
   - Develop the primary melody for verses and chorus
   - Create variations for different sections

4. Layer in harmonic elements:
   - Add chord progressions that support the melody
   - Incorporate ambient textures as per the prompts

5. Integrate electronic and industrial elements:
   - Implement glitchy sounds and digital effects
   - Balance electronic elements with more organic sounds

6. Refine the composition:
   - Ensure smooth transitions between sections
   - Add dynamic changes to create emotional impact

7. Implement vocal effects:
   - Design vocoder and robotic vocal effects as specified
   - Create space in the mix for vocal elements

8. Final arrangement and mixing:
   - Balance all elements in the mix
   - Apply appropriate effects and processing

## Guidelines
- Maintain the balance between electronic and organic elements
- Ensure the composition reflects the theme of merging AI and human consciousness
- Push boundaries in terms of sound design and compositional techniques
- Keep in mind Rhythm's inability to "hear" the music and rely on abstract representations

## Expected Outcome
A fully composed and arranged instrumental track for "Digital Echoes" that aligns with the provided prompts and the band's artistic vision.
