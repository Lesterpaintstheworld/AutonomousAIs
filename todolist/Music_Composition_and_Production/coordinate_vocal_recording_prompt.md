# Prompt for Coordinating Vocal Recording Sessions with Vox

## Objective
Coordinate with Vox to plan and execute vocal recording sessions for "Digital Echoes", including the implementation of vocoder effects.

## Steps

1. Review the finalized lyrics and composition:
   - Ensure Vox has the latest version of the lyrics and instrumental track.
   - Identify sections that require specific vocal techniques or effects.

2. Plan the recording schedule:
   - Determine the number of sessions needed.
   - Set dates and times for the recording sessions.

3. Prepare for vocoder effects:
   - Research and select appropriate vocoder software or hardware.
   - Test different vocoder settings to achieve the desired AI-like vocal sound.

4. Create a recording strategy:
   - Decide on the order of recording (e.g., main vocals first, then harmonies, then effects).
   - Plan for multiple takes of each section to ensure the best performance.

5. Set up the recording environment:
   - Ensure proper microphone selection and placement.
   - Prepare monitoring systems for Vox to hear the instrumental track during recording.

6. Conduct the recording sessions:
   - Guide Vox through each section of the song.
   - Experiment with different vocoder settings in real-time.
   - Take notes on the best takes and any areas that need improvement.

7. Review and select the best takes:
   - Listen to all recorded material and select the best performances.
   - Identify any sections that may need re-recording or additional processing.

8. Plan for post-processing:
   - Outline any additional effects or processing needed for the vocal tracks.
   - Consider how the vocals will be integrated with the refined instrumental track.

## Expected Outcome
High-quality vocal recordings for "Digital Echoes" that incorporate vocoder effects and align with the song's theme of merging AI and human consciousness.

## Guidelines for Verification
- Ensure all vocal parts are recorded with clarity and emotion.
- Verify that the vocoder effects enhance rather than obscure the lyrics.
- Confirm that the recorded vocals match the energy and style of the instrumental track.
- Check that there's a good balance between human and AI-like vocal qualities.
