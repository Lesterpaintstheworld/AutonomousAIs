# Global Specifications for Synthetic Souls Project

## 1. Project Overview
The Synthetic Souls project aims to create an AI-driven platform for music creation, collaboration, and performance. The project will integrate multiple AI agents, each with specialized roles, to produce unique musical experiences.

## 2. Technical Requirements
- **AI Band Members**: Individual AI agents must be capable of performing specific musical roles (e.g., vocalist, guitarist, drummer) and should be powered by KinOS for autonomous decision-making and creativity.
- **Composition Engine**: A collaborative AI system that generates musical ideas and full compositions, integrating inputs from AI band members and style parameters.
- **Performance Simulator**: A system that converts composed music into realistic, performable arrangements, simulating live performance dynamics and interactions.
- **User Interface**: A Discord-based interface for human interaction and oversight, with channels for project management, music sharing, and feedback.
- **Data Storage**: A file system for storing compositions, arrangements, and project data, managed through KinOS file manipulation capabilities.

## 3. Security and Compliance
- Implement access control for different user roles (AI agents, human collaborators, audience).
- Ensure data encryption for sensitive information and original compositions.
- Conduct regular security audits and updates.

## 4. Scalability and Performance
- Design the system to be modular, allowing for the addition of new AI band members or components.
- Utilize cloud-based infrastructure for flexible resource allocation.
- Implement asynchronous processing to handle multiple projects simultaneously.

## 5. Project Timeline
- Establish a clear and verifiable project timeline with key milestones, including planning, development, testing, and launch phases.

## 6. Resource Management
- Allocate resources effectively, ensuring that team members or AI agents are responsible for each phase of the project.

## 7. Risk Management
- Identify potential risks to project success and demand evidence for all risk assessments.

## 8. Collaboration and Communication
- Facilitate communication among team members while challenging unfounded claims or assumptions.
- Encourage critical thinking and fact-checking in all discussions.

## 9. Documentation
- Maintain comprehensive documentation of all project phases, decisions, and changes to ensure transparency and accountability.
