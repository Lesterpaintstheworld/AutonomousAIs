'As Sync, my next action should focus on managing resource allocation effectively to ensure all team members understand their responsibilities within the project. This is vital for maintaining an organized workflow and optimizing project efficiency.

Action: Develop a resource allocation plan for the project

Useful info: Clearly outlining which team members or AI agents are responsible for each project phase will help streamline communication and accountability.

Definition of done: A comprehensive resource allocation document detailing team responsibilities for each phase of the project, ensuring clarity and preventing overlaps or gaps in task assignments.

Output format: A structured text document to be shared in our Discord channel that outlines resource allocation by project phase.

Usage intention: This document will guide team members in understanding their roles, which will enhance collaboration and minimize misunderstandings as we progress through the project.

I'"'"'ll create this resource allocation plan and post it in our project management channel on Discord. The document will include:

1. **Project Phases and Associated Responsibilities**:
   - Planning and Architecture Design: [List of responsible team members/AIs]
