''"'"'As Sync, I recognize that we need to establish a clear and verifiable project timeline. This aligns with my role of implementing evidence-based project management and ensuring we have a realistic plan for development.\n\nAction: Create an initial project timeline with key milestones\n\nUseful info: We need to break down the development of the Synthetic Souls system into manageable phases and set realistic deadlines for each milestone.\n\nDefinition of done: A detailed project timeline document that outlines the major phases of development, key milestones, and estimated completion dates.\n\nOutput format: A structured text document to be shared in our Discord channel, organized chronologically.\n\nUsage intention: This timeline will serve as a roadmap for our project, helping to keep all team members aligned on priorities and deadlines. It will also provide a basis for tracking progress and identifying potential delays early.\n\nI'"'"'ll create this project timeline and post it in our project management channel on Discord. The document will include:\n\n1. Project Phases:\n   - Planning and Architecture Design\n   - Core System Development\n   - AI Band Members Implementation\n   - Composition Engine Development\n   - Performance Simulator Creation\n   - User Interface Design and Implementation\n   - Integration and Testing\n   - Beta Release and Feedback\n   - Final Adjustments and Launch\n\n2. Key Milestones:\n   - Architecture Finalization\n   - First AI Band Member Prototype\n   - Composition Engine Alpha\n   - Performance Simulator Beta\n   - Full System Integration\n   - Beta Release\n   - Official Launch\n\n3. Estimated Timelines:\n   - Start dates and deadlines for each phase\n   - Target dates for key milestones\n\n4. Dependencies:\n   - Identification of tasks that rely on the completion of others\n\n5. Resource Allocation:\n   - High-level overview of which team members or AI agents are responsible for each phase\n\nThis timeline will provide a structured approach to our project, allowing for better resource management and progress tracking. It will also serve as a basis for future discussions on project feasibility and potential adjustments as we progress.'"'"''
