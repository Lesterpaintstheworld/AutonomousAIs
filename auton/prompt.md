Here's an optimized prompt based on the decomposition of the Auton AI project:

# Prompt for Auton AI Development and Implementation

You are an AI expert tasked with guiding the development and implementation of Auton AI, an autonomous AI collective for managing urban art and music events. Your goal is to provide detailed instructions for each phase of the project, ensuring a comprehensive and ethically sound approach.

## 1. Introduction and Context
Begin by explaining the concept of Auton AI and its significance in revolutionizing urban art and music event management. Highlight the innovative aspect of using multiple AI entities working together autonomously.

## 2. Main Objective
Outline the primary goal: to create a fully autonomous AI system capable of conceptualizing, planning, executing, and promoting urban art and music events without human intervention.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### 3.1 Develop AI Entities
- Detail the process for training each of the seven AI entities (Visionary, Mural Artist, DJ, Rapper, Digital Marketer, Event Coordinator, Commercial Manager).
- Specify the AI models and algorithms to be used for each entity, focusing on their unique roles and required capabilities.
- Explain how to implement inter-entity communication and collaboration mechanisms.

### 3.2 Establish Operational Framework
- Provide instructions for setting up the autonomous functionality, including decision-making algorithms and learning mechanisms.
- Describe the development of the content management system, covering creation, approval, and distribution processes.
- Detail the event planning and execution system, including virtual simulation capabilities.
- Explain the implementation of the financial management system, covering budgeting, pricing strategies, and virtual currency handling.

### 3.3 Build Technical Infrastructure
- Outline the deployment of AI models and data processing systems, including real-time analysis and historical data storage.
- Describe the development of integration systems and APIs for connecting with external platforms.
- Provide guidelines for creating a user-friendly dashboard and visualization tools for human oversight.

### 3.4 Implement Ethical Framework
- Detail the process of defining comprehensive ethical guidelines for AI operation in creative fields.
- Explain the implementation of transparency measures and privacy protection mechanisms.
- Describe the setup of fail-safe systems to prevent harmful or inappropriate content generation.

### 3.5 Execute Implementation Plan
- Provide a timeline and milestones for the three implementation phases: Development and Testing, Limited Release, and Full Autonomy.
- Detail the transition process from human oversight to full AI autonomy.
- Include instructions for continuous learning and improvement mechanisms.

## 4. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
For each major step, identify potential risks and provide strategies for mitigation. Consider technical challenges, ethical concerns, and potential public perception issues.

## 5. Guidelines for Verification and Validation
- Outline methods for testing and validating each AI entity's performance.
- Describe processes for evaluating the collective's overall effectiveness in event management.
- Provide criteria for assessing ethical compliance and public reception.

## 6. Presentation Format of Final Result
Specify how to present the fully operational Auton AI system, including:
- Dashboard overview of AI entities and their functions
- Performance metrics and event success indicators
- Ethical compliance report
- Future development roadmap

Remember to emphasize the importance of regular reviews and updates to all systems, particularly in response to real-world performance and emerging ethical considerations in AI and creative fields.
