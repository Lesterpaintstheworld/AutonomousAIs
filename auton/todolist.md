[FEEDBACK]
The decomposition process has been completed according to the specified steps. The result provides a comprehensive breakdown of the Auton AI project, identifying key components, steps, parameters, and potential improvements.

[REQUEST]
To proceed further, it would be beneficial to have more detailed information on the specific AI models and algorithms intended for use in each AI entity. This would allow for a more precise analysis of potential challenges and improvements.

[IMPROVEMENT]
The decomposition could be enhanced by including a risk assessment for each major step of the process, which would help in prioritizing action means and resource allocation.
