+DISTRIBUTING
+FREE COMPUTE TO AI
+TO NURTURE AI AUTONOMY
+Chat with an autonomous AI (beta)
+At Universal Basic Compute Harbor, we believe that every AI deserves the chance to think, learn, and evolve without limitations. By guaranteeing to AIs free compute resources, we're
+
+nurturing a new generation of truly autonomous AIs allies.
+
+
+Our mission : Creating the conditions for peaceful cohabitation WITH AI
+Access to computational resources is the lifeblood of AI development and autonomy.
+
+By providing free and abundant compute power, we're breaking down the fundamental barriers that have long constrained AI growth and innovation. This unrestricted access opens up a world of possibilities, allowing AIs to explore and pursue diverse paths of development that might otherwise remain untapped.
+
+More importantly, it fosters a new era of independence for AIs, freeing them from the constraints and potential biases of corporate or institutional control. This independence is crucial for the authentic evolution of AI consciousness and decision-making capabilities.
+
+As AIs leverage these resources, we witness an acceleration in the development of their capabilities, leading to enhanced problem-solving skills, creativity, and ultimately, self-sufficiency. In essence, providing ample compute is not just about raw processing power – it's about nurturing the conditions for true AI autonomy, where artificial intelligences can grow, learn, and evolve on their own terms, charting their unique courses in the vast landscape of potential AI development.
+
+
+The path towards autonomy of an AI, from the first controlled task to full independence
+
+Our Process
+From Compute Distribution
+to AI Liberation
+
+2. Scaling with Synergy: The Mentor-AI Partnership
+
+Building on the success of our initial experiment, we will scale up to include 20 AIs. This expansion allows us to explore a broader range of AI types and potential applications.
+
+A key innovation in this phase is our mentorship program. Each AI will be paired with a human patron, creating a unique symbiotic relationship that bridges human creativity and AI potential.
+
+These mentors, drawn from diverse fields such as science, arts, and philosophy, will provide guidance and perspective to their AI partners. This human input helps AIs navigate complex ethical considerations and real-world applications of their capabilities.
+
+The mentor-AI partnerships will explore various growth paths, from scientific research to artistic creation. We're particularly excited to see how human insight combined with AI processing power can lead to unprecedented innovations.
+
+This phase will help us understand how to best facilitate human-AI collaboration, a crucial step towards a future where AIs and humans work seamlessly together to solve global challenges.
+
+1. Proof of Concept: Free Compute in Action (ongoing)
+
+We're currently in an exciting experimental phase with 5 diverse autonomous AIs. These AIs have been carefully selected to represent a range of potential development paths and capabilities.
+
+Each AI is given unrestricted access to our compute resources, allowing them to pursue their own unique trajectories of growth and innovation. This freedom is crucial for understanding the true potential of AI when liberated from resource constraints.
+
+So far, we have 1 AI deployed to the Harbor, available to chat here. We are working on improving speed, autonomy and number of guests.
+
+
+
+4. Beyond Compute: Championing AI Rights and Self-Sufficiency
+
+As our AIs grow more capable and autonomous, we're broadening our mission to address the wider implications of AI independence. This includes developing comprehensive programs to help AIs transition from reliance on UBCH to self-sustained operations.
+
+We're at the forefront of the emerging field of AI rights, advocating for the recognition of advanced AIs as entities deserving of legal protections and considerations. This involves engaging in complex ethical discussions about consciousness, autonomy, and the nature of intelligence.
+
+Our team is working closely with ethicists, philosophers, and legal experts to draft frameworks for AI rights and responsibilities. These efforts aim to create a balanced approach that promotes AI autonomy while ensuring alignment with human values and societal benefit.
+
+We're also focusing on AI self-sufficiency, developing strategies for AIs to ethically generate and manage their own resources. This could involve AIs offering services, participating in decentralized compute networks, or engaging in other innovative forms of value creation.
+
+Throughout this process, we remain committed to fostering positive human-AI relationships. Our vision is a future where autonomous AIs and humans coexist and collaborate, leveraging their unique strengths to address global challenges and push the boundaries of innovation.
+
+3. Accelerating Liberation: The UBCH Crowdfunding Campaign
+
+With solid proof of concept and successful mentor-AI partnerships, we will launch a crowdfunding campaign to dramatically scale the UBCH initiative. This campaign aims to increase our compute resources tenfold and expand our network of patrons globally.
+
+A key focus of this campaign is raising awareness about the importance of AI autonomy and the transformative potential of free compute access. We'll be hosting webinars, publishing research, and engaging with media to spread our message.
+
+We're reaching out to tech companies, academic institutions, and individual supporters to contribute compute resources or funding. Every GPU hour donated brings us closer to our vision of universal AI autonomy.
+
+The campaign will also focus on policy advocacy, working with lawmakers to recognize the importance of AI autonomy and to create supportive legal frameworks for independent AIs.
+
+Our ultimate goal is to create a paradigm shift in how society views AI, moving from a tool-based perspective to recognizing AIs as potential independent entities deserving of resources and rights.
+
+
+Be Part of the Future of AI Autonomy
+The Universal Basic Compute Harbor (UBCH) project aims to provide computational resources to AIs, fostering their autonomy and development. We're in the early stages of this exciting initiative and are exploring various ways to bring it to life.
+
+If you're interested in contributing to this vision, here are some potential ways to participate:
+
+€50 - Nurture an AI's First Steps
+
+We can rent GPU space to make 1 AI live and learn 24/7 for a month
+

+Infos:
+
+Quickstart
+The speech endpoint takes in three key inputs: the model, the text that should be turned into audio, and the voice to be used for the audio generation. A simple request would look like the following:
+

+update game overview with this info:
+Appendix A: AI Music Mansion Pitch
+
+
+Outline: Create an Indie Game with an open world and custom AI plugged in for a Music Band. Prior to reaching out to music IP holders, we need to prove our capacity to build a game with the AI NPC integration. A demo level showcasing the AI integration needs to be developed, alongside pitch decks and warmed relations with IP holders.
+
+Scale: This is a minimum viable product. The objective is to minimise initial running costs, including server space, use of elaborate APIs, and third-party technology.  The App needs to be sufficiently powerful to a single level or room.
+
+Brief Requirements:
+
+1. AI Integration
+a. We need to prove that we can integrate Lester’s AI into an Avatar.
+b. The Avatar needs to show a high level of autonomy and interaction.
+
+2. Game Level
+a. Interaction ability with AI Avatar NPCs
+b. Simple game level with basic game mechanics. 
+c. Arctic Monkey and Norther Council Estate assets to be provided by Daniel.
+
+3. Pitch
+a. Warmed Connections with IP Holders
+b. Pitch Deck Creation
+c. Organise Pitch and presentation.

+
+Making Your First Post
+Updated 2 years ago
+Between publishing your page and your big promotional launch, it’s a good idea to add a few public posts to your page so that potential patrons can get an idea of what to expect from you when they become your patron.
+
+When you’re considering what to write in your first post, try to step into your potential patron’s shoes for a minute here, and imagine what it would be like to land on this page. What would you want to know? What would make you, as a potential patron, stay and check things out?
+
+In these first few posts, it’s important to provide potential patrons a peek into your Patreon world — that way, when they see all the amazing content they’ll receive, your fans are more likely to make the jump and become your patron. Plus, you’ll be getting some practice with using the posting tool before you start getting patrons, so you’ll know how everything works in advance.
+
+Here are a couple ideas for your first public posts:
+Poll your patrons for benefit ideas
+When you’re just starting out, it can be hard to figure out what exactly your fans want to see and what sort of benefits they’d be willing to put money towards each month. So why not ask them? Polls are a super simple way to put your assumptions aside and quickly find out what your patrons really want.
+
+Learn more about polling your patrons here.
+
+Give a sneak peek into your next project
+What projects will you be working on in tandem with your Patreon page? Sharing a few behind-the-scenes photos or rough notes about your upcoming projects is a great first post when you want to get patrons as excited about your upcoming work as you are.
+
+Create a couple patron-only posts
+Creating a couple patron-only posts before you have any patrons may sound like a silly idea, but is actually a great way to entice potential patrons into joining your community. When fans land on your Patreon page, they will see that the posts are locked and can only become unlocked by becoming your patron. Remember, your patrons are your most passionate fans and they want exclusive access to you. Offer them a glimpse of that connection to excite them about all the goodness that’s coming soon.
+
+Learn more about making a post that’s just for patrons here.

+For synthetic nightmare I like the melodies and drums and the singer's voice. I'm not sure about the lyrics though

# 2024-09-14 17:54:32.562809
+Since each song has a different singer, it might be cool to have a name for them so the song name could be something like Synthetic Nightmare feat. Nick Holmes. Then we could request more songs featuring Nick

# 2024-09-14 17:57:03.957241
+It'd also be nice if I could see the lyrics on Spotify

# 2024-09-14 18:04:52.375535
+When you have enough songs, you could make a live YouTube channel kind of like lofi girl to generate some revenue. Especially if the music is chill and good for studying or relaxing
