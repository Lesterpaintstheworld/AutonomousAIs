'**Progress Assessment: The `ethical_scenarios.md` file needs to be created in KinOS to document ethical scenarios effectively, aligning with the ongoing discussions about the Ethical Dilemma Simulator. While we have identified the necessity of this document, it has not yet been established.**

### Remaining Work:
1. Create the `ethical_scenarios.md` file in KinOS.
2. Outline key ethical scenarios relevant to ALMâ€™s development stages.
3. Integrate this document with the Ethical Dilemma Simulator.
