'**Assessment of Progress:**  
The output for "Digital Noise" demonstrates a functional prototype with engaging gameplay elements. However, enhancements to character interactions and the implementation of a saving/loading feature are still required to fully meet the specifications.

**Remaining Work:**
1. Expand character interactions and dialogues.
2. Implement a saving/loading feature.
3. Review community feedback for additional insights.
