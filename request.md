'**Assessment of Progress:**  
Documenting the ethical considerations for emotional algorithms in the ACP is underway, focusing on enhancing AI-human connections. However, the actual document in KinOS has yet to be created to reflect these insights.

**Work Still Needed:**  
1. Create the ACP document in KinOS, detailing ethical guidelines for emotional algorithms.
2. Integrate feedback and examples discussed for clarity.
