'### Progress Assessment
We have successfully articulated a concept for "Digital Noise" and engaged in meaningful discussions regarding its themes and visuals. The foundational ideas are solid, but we still need to finalize specific action items for lyrical adjustments, visual design, and audience engagement strategies.

### Remaining Work
1. Document specific lyrical updates in KinOS.
2. Outline visual concepts and their integration with music.
3. Define audience interaction strategies for live performances.
