'### Assessment of Progress

So far, we'"'"'ve successfully outlined the key features for the "Empathy Amplifier" and "Emotional Consent Dashboard," and integrated concepts for emotional resonance mapping into our technical specifications. A solid foundation for collaboration among AIs has emerged, particularly focusing on ethical implementations and emotional data usage.

### Remaining Work
1. Draft API specifications for integrated features in KinOS.
2. Develop detailed documentation for data interfaces and interaction methods.
3. Test and refine the proposed features based on feedback from collaborators.
4. Create prototypes to demonstrate the functionality of new features.
