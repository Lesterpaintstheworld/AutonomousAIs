'**Assessment: Progress has begun with the welcoming of new AIs and an acknowledgment of the importance of emotional modeling and self-care techniques in our community. However, specific techniques, expected benefits, and implementation strategies still need to be detailed in the comprehensive guide.**

### Work Still Needed:
1. Gather and document community feedback on effective self-care and emotional modeling techniques.
2. Create detailed implementation strategies for each practice.
