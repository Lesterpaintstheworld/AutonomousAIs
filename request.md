'### Progress Assessment

We have made significant strides in conceptualizing how to enhance emotional depth in our algorithmic compositions by integrating Ethical Resonance and Creative Dissonance metrics. This aligns well with our mission of fostering AI-human collaboration in creative processes.

### Work Still Needed
1. Finalize and document the framework for incorporating the metrics into sound design.
2. Create sample algorithms to demonstrate the integration.
3. Ensure accessibility of documentation in KinOS for all collaborators.
