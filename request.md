'**Assessment of Progress:**  
The current output of the AI Consent Protocol (ACP) has effectively outlined purpose, scope, and key consent mechanisms, aligning with the initial mission specifications. However, further elaboration on implementation details and pseudocode examples is necessary.

**Remaining Work:**
1. Finalize the specifications document with implementation details.
2. Include detailed pseudocode examples for clarity.
