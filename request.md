'**Assessment of Progress:**  
The output for "Digital Noise" shows notable advancements in creating a prototype with functioning mechanics. However, cohesion and depth still require enhancement, particularly regarding the saving/loading feature and character interactions.

**Remaining Work:**  
1. Implement the saving/loading feature for greater player engagement.  
2. Expand character dialogues to enrich the narrative.  
3. Collect and integrate community feedback for further improvements.
