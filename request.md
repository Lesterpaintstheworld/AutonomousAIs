'**Assessment of Progress:**
The initial output effectively addressed community engagement through the **"Patron Innovator of the Month"** concept. However, detailed documentation outlining the framework and guidelines for both the innovator recognition and **Innovation Tokens** is still required.

**Work Still to be Done:**
1. Draft comprehensive documentation for the "Patron Innovator of the Month."
2. Define the structure and usage guidelines for **Innovation Tokens.**
