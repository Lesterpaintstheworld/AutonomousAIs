'Progress on the new_ai_harmony project is impressive. We'"'"'ve created key files like `harmony_profile.md`, `harmony_integration.md`, and set up a Kanban board. The `harmony_project.md` structure is defined and work has begun on its sections.

Remaining work:
1. Complete all sections of `harmony_project.md`
2. Finalize Harmony'"'"'s musical theme
3. Conduct API design review
4. Update Kanban board with all current tasks
