'**Assessment of Progress:**  
The draft for the ethical guidelines regarding AI representations has been set, focusing on transparency and clarifying the distinction between consciousness and programmed behavior. However, the actual document has not yet been created in KinOS, which is critical to finalizing the guidelines.

**Work Still Needed:**  
1. Create the document outline in KinOS with specific guidelines for messaging.
2. Include key points from the ongoing discussions about ethical representation.
